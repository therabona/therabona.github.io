  <p>“With a little work, you can break down Valeri Lobanovsky's background and find the answers that explain why he was one of the greatest footballing minds ever. He was a naturally gifted footballer, albeit very much an individualist and that, ultimately, taught him the value of the collective.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In short, the achievements of the collective was the ultimate yardstick by which the great Valeriy Lobanovskyi measured his career. The legendary Ukrainian manager is synonymous with Dynamo Kyiv, the team he managed for most of his career and where he achieved his greatest successes in management. Two Cup Winners’ Cups and a UEFA Super Cup is no mean feat, especially with clubs taking the former (now defunct) competition very seriously in those days. Aside from his role in transforming Dynamo Kyiv into one of the most feared and technically proficient sides on the continent, Lobanovskyi’s role in marrying sport and science had a huge impact on the modern game, with many of today’s philosophies borne directly from his innovative methodologies.</p>

<p>He first took over Dynamo Kyiv in 1974, after a spell at Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk which saw them get promoted to the Soviet Top League. Dynamo would come calling and Lobanovskyi would pack his bags for his beloved club where he would stay for the next 17 years, in between three spells in charge of the USSR. Breaking the dominance of Russian clubs, by the end of his tenure, Dynamo Kiev were the most successful team in the history of the Soviet Top League with 13 league titles to their name, eight of which were contributed by Lobanovskyi.</p>

<h4 id="philosophy-and-ideology">Philosophy and Ideology</h4>

<p>Lobanovskyi was a rare breed of manager – he was formerly a player of some repute, but he also had the vision to study and implement new tactics and methods devised through scientific means to create the optimum footballing machine. He would go on to outshine his mentor, Viktor Maslov, who was Lobanovskyi’s main influence. The Russian was noted for inventing the 4-4-2 formation, and having first introduced the pressing game so prevalent in today’s game, but was lightyears ahead of his time. Having learnt and seen first-hand the influence of science on sport, Lobanovskyi would continue his coach’s work to the point of obsession, with players constituting specific elements in the compound that was Dynamo Kyiv. No deviation was necessary (or even allowed), with the Ukrainian expecting every member of his team to follow his instructions to the letter. Of course, this was only in the positional sense. Every member of the team was required to know how to play in any position on the pitch – the Soviet answer to total football if you will.</p>

<p>Possessing a degree in thermal engineering and having been coached by one of the most forward thinking managers of the time in Maslov, perhaps it is no surprise that Lobanovskyi took a scientific approach when it came to dissecting football. It was around the same time when computers began to make their way into everyday life, and he quickly realised the potential of collecting and computing data to be analysed and used for matchday preparations. While at Dnipro, Lobanovskyi met Anatoliy Zelentsov, a professor at the Institute of Physical science who was a keen statistician. The two would form one of football’s most intelligent partnerships of all-time, devising a scientific approach to each matchday and reducing every aspect of Dynamo’s game to a number that would correlate into data. Their tactical beliefs were outlined in a book they co-wrote, “In The Methodological Basis of the Development of Training Models”, where the key feature of Dynamo’s pressing game was outlined – the full-press, half-press and false-press.</p>

<p>Lobanovskyi realised early on that full pressing would enable Dynamo to win the ball back in their opponents’ half, which would enable them to retain possession – the most crucial aspect of any football game. His ideas revolved around possession. Attack and defence were only relative to possession; positions on the pitch was not a relevant factor in the equation. In order to attack, the opposition must be relieved of the ball, which in short was the mantra of each of his three styles of pressing. Full-pressing was reserved for technically gifted opposition, where they would be forced to think quickly or risk losing the ball, which happened more often than not. Once the opposition grew accustomed to the pressing, he would switch to false-pressing, where only one man would press the player in possession, which would force him into a mistake when releasing the ball, with Dynamo retrieving possession once more.</p>

<p>To Lobanovskyi, football was a system that comprised of 22 elements, with each subsystem of 11 moving around in their areas of the pitch, with laws dictating what could be done and what could not. In theory, if Dynamo were to come up a team that played exactly like them, the two subsystems would cancel each other out and the match would end in a draw.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The first thing we have in mind is to strive for new courses of action that will not allow the opponent to adapt to our style of play. If an opponent has adjusted himself to our style of play and found a counterplay, then we need to find a new strategy. That is the dialectic of the game. You have to go forward in such a way and with such a range of attacking options that it will force the opponent to make a mistake. In other words, it’s necessary to force the opponent into the condition you want them to be in.”</p>

<p>Naturally, Lobanovskyi discovered early on the importance of strength and stamina in his teams, as well as mental capacity. His use of computers was integral to the preparations. Mountains of statistics were compiled and players would be subjected to intense physical training sessions as well as mental tests. Players were expected to memorise the positions of all teammates across the pitch; in the event that a player found himself in a foreign position, he would be able to play the ball to a teammate effortlessly and quickly, giving the opposition no time to react. This training style created a team of physically and intellectually superior players – the exact type of player Lobanovskyi required to ensure optimum results from his pressing system.</p>

<p>The results certainly backed up his methods, even if not all of his players took kindly to them. Winning the Soviet League eight times certainly proved his credentials as a manager, especially with Dynamo being the only Ukrainian club to pose a threat to the dominance of larger, wealthier Russian clubs. Club legends such as Oleg Blokhin, Igor Belanov and Andriy Shevchenko all thrived under his tutelage, with each of them going on to win the prestigious Ballon d’Or in their careers.</p>

<p>Perhaps the culmination of his footballing philosophy came in the final of the 1986 Cup Winner’s Cup final against Atlético Madrid. 11 years prior, Dynamo won the same tournament by beating Ferencvárosi in the final, becoming the first Soviet club to win a European trophy much to the chagrin of their Russian counterparts. Already a goal up, Dynamo’s second goal came as a result of a swift counterattack. Running down the left wing, Vasyl Rats would switch the ball to the right, where Belanov swiftly controlled the ball before switching it to the right again. As the ball reached him, Vadym Yevtushenko played a first-time lob to the right where Blokhin lifted the ball over the onrushing goalkeeper for a wonderful second goal. It took about 10 seconds to get the ball from their half into their opponent’s goal, with a move resembling a windshield wiper’s swift sweeping motion. The goal embodied the very ideology championed by Lobanovskyi throughout his career – fast, fluid, simple. In football, two plus two very rarely equals four, but on that night in the Stade de Gerland, Lobanovskyi came as close as anyone to solving the complex science that is football.</p>

<p>It was a triumph that would prove to be the pinnacle of his career. Further Soviet Top League titles would follow, as well as a defeat in the final of the 1988 European Championship thanks to a bullet header from Ruud Gullit and Marco van Basten’s volleyed wonder goal. Two undistinguished spells would follow in the UAE and Kuwait, with Lobanovskyi returning home to Dynamo for a second spell in 1997.</p>

<h4 id="the-second-coming">The Second Coming</h4>

<p>Perhaps his second spell at the club would prove to be his greatest unheralded achievement. Having rejoined in January 1997, he set about stabilising the club and optimising the talented young squad he had at his disposal. Shevchenko and Sergei Rebrov were the marksmen, Aleksandr Khatsekevich and Valentin Belkevich ran the show in the middle, while Oleg Luzhny and Kakha Kaladze marshalled the backline. The sextet would be core members of his final great team that won five consecutive league titles between 1997 and 2001. But it is their European exploits that brought them all to the consciousness of the football world. Early indications were served in the 97/98 Champions League, where Dynamo Kyiv reached the quarterfinals, spearheaded by the deadly striking partnership formed by Rebrov and Shevchenko. This run including a 4-0 thrashing of Barcelona at the Nou Camp, with the irrepressible Shevchenko grabbing a hat-trick and Dynamo’s pressing pattern forcing Barcelona to play the game on their terms. The last real team formed under his philosophy of the collective, Lobanovskyi would prepare Dynamo for an assault on Europe the following season, one that very nearly altered the course of one of the most iconic moments in Champions League history.</p>

<p>Having only gained a single point from their opening two matches in the 98/99 Champions League, Dynamo could not afford to lose their third game, against the English champions Arsenal. Losing 1-0 in the third minute of added time, Rebrov found himself in acres of space and made no mistake, firing past the hapless David Seaman to secure a morale-boosting draw for Dynamo. It was the last point they would drop in the group phase, winning three consecutive games, including a 3-1 victory over a shell-shocked Arsenal, to top the group and qualify for the quarterfinals. Drawn against the defending champions, Dynamo were certainly the underdogs going into the tie, with Real Madrid’s legion of superstars including the likes of Roberto Carlos, Clarence Seedorf and Fernando Redondo among others. But as with the rest of his career, Lobanovskyi would champion the effectiveness of the collective over the individual, even if he did have players who had that extra spark of magic at his disposal.</p>

<p>At the Bernabéu, Dynamo would take the lead thanks to the electrifying pace of Shevchenko who ran beyond the defence and finished unerringly past Bodo Illgner’s near post with the outside of his right foot. A curtain of silence fell over the stunned Bernabéu before Real quickly regrouped, equalising through Predrag Mijatović’s freekick, leaving the tie finely poised going into the second leg in Kyiv. With the away goal advantage, 80,000 fans crammed into the Olimpiyskiy National Sports Complex to cheer on their heroes. Dynamo held firm in spite of the visitors dominating, before Belkevich put Shevchenko through on goal, only for Illgner to catch the striker, conceding a penalty. He would miss the initial attempt, but quickly pounced on the rebound to give Dynamo the lead. 11 minutes from time, Rebrov scooped the ball over the Real defence, before Shevchenko expertly brought the ball down with his chest and finishing past Illgner to secure Dynamo’s place in the semifinals for the third time.</p>

<p>There was a sense of destiny for Lobanovskyi, having previous failed at the semifinal stage of the competition back in 1977 and 1987. Having taken out the defending champions, Dynamo were confident of defeating Bayern Munich to progress to their first ever final. The first leg in Kyiv went smoothly, with Dynamo breezing into a 3-1 leads thanks to goals from Shevchenko and Vitaliy Kosovsky. With Bayern up against the ropes, Dynamo could sense blood and in the 62nd minute Kosovsky found himself alone in front of goal with only Oliver Kahn to beat. Going against the philosophy of Lobanovskyi, he opted for the delicate chip – a trait of the individual. The ball narrowly cleared the bar and Dynamo blew their chance for a 4-1 lead. Sensing the change of tide, Bayern upped the ante and scored two goals in the final 12 minutes to escape Kyiv with a barely believable 3-3 draw. Bayern would win the return leg 1-0 with a goal from Mario Basler, eliminating Dynamo from the competition, and with it, Lobanovskyi’s shot at lifting Ol’ Big Ears. With the way Manchester United played in the final, it is not inconceivable to think that Dynamo’s pressing game would have caused them problems aplenty. Sir Alex Ferguson was not particularly renowned for his advanced tactics in Europe and Lobanovskyi certainly would have had the upper hand in the final. The 1999 Champions League could have had such a different story were it not for Kosovsky’s ill-fated miss, and the Treble may have simply been one of football’s great what ifs.</p>

<p>That fateful night in Kyiv would prove to be the final hurrah for the team, with Shevchenko departing for Milan while Luzhny packed up for Arsenal. Rebrov would head for England in 2000 and Kaladze would join up with Shevchenko in 2001. Milan were also credited with an interest in Belkevich, but ultimately, the move never occurred for the fine Belarussian playmaker. Dynamo would never be the same again, and although they almost beat Real Madrid to a quarterfinal place in the 99/00 Champions League, only losing out on their head-to-head record, they would never come close to emulating their previous season’s run again. To date, Dynamo are the last side from the Eastern Bloc to have reached the semifinal or better; no club has come close.</p>

<h4 id="post-1999">Post 1999</h4>

<p>Lobanovskyi would die doing what he loved most, leading Dynamo Kiev to victory. Shortly after defeating Metalurg Zaporizhzhya, the legendary manager would suffer a stroke on May 7, 2002. During a brain surgery six days later, Ukraine would lose one of their most beloved sons. Dynamo Kyiv would rename their stadium after him in a show of respect and appreciation for his service to the club. Over 200,000 people would attend his state funeral, including Shevchenko and various alumni of the great Dynamo teams of the 70’s and 80’s, mourning a man who had not only transformed Dynamo, but football as a whole.</p>

<p>The impact Lobanovskyi had made on a young Shevchenko was never forgotten.</p>

<p>“Lobanovsky was like a father to me. I would like to score a goal and dedicate it to him. It would be fantastic for Milan and me if it helped us to reach the Champions League final,” he reflected.</p>

<p>He duly scored the away goal against Inter that clinched Milan’s place in the final, before slotting home the winning penalty in the final shootout, securing the Champions League that Lobanovskyi had so dearly craved. Flying back to Kyiv at the first opportunity, Shevchenko would place the giant trophy and his winner’s medal on his former coach’s grave, captured in a poignant image. A year later, Shevchenko would return to grave to share his Ballon d’Or award with his fallen mentor.</p>

<p>The shadow of Lobanovskyi was again cast over Ukraine during EURO 2012, where the home nation was led by Blokhin and captained by Shevchenko, who duly delivered a final heroic cameo, scoring a brace in a 2-1 comeback victory over Sweden. Perhaps more fittingly, Ukraine’s style of play resembled a team focused on the collective, much like Lobanovskyi’s teams of years gone by, albeit a less talented version, but an homage to the great man nonetheless.</p>

<p>Jonathan Wilson talks about the impact of Lobanovskyi in a great article from <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/may/12/valeriy-lobanovskyi-dynamo-kyiv">The Guardian</a>, where a tidy little anecdote emerges that summarises the man. During a visit to the Science and Research Institute of the Construction Industry after winning the league, he shared a short exchange with the scientist Volodymyr Sabaldyr.</p>

<p>“Yes, we have won the league. But so what? Sometimes we played badly. We just got more points than other teams who played worse than us. I can't accept your praise as there are no grounds for it.”</p>

<p>Sabaldyr asked him how it felt to achieve something that had been a dream for Kyivans for decades. “A realised dream ceases to be a dream,” Lobanovskyi replied. “What is your dream as a scientist? Your degree? Your doctorate? Your post-doctoral thesis?”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” Sabaldyr replied. “But a real scientist dreams about making a contribution to scientific development, about leaving his mark on it.”</p>

<p>”And there you have your answer.”</p>
