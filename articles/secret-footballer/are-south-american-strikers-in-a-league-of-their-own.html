  <p>“I have said many times that Europe still produces many fantastic football players, but if you look well we do not produce strikers well.”</p>

<p></p>

<p>In an interview last year, the Arsenal manager went on record stating that he believed South America currently produces the best strikers in the world. A quick glance at a list of top strikers in Europe certainly seems to add weight to his claims, with the likes of Neymar, Radamel Falcao, Sergio Agüero, Luis Suárez and Lionel Messi undoubtedly among the world’s greatest marksmen. Their lesser known countrymen also ply their trade in many of Europe’s weaker leagues, as well as around the world in outposts from Canada to Qatar to Australia.</p>

<p>South America has always been known worldwide for their steady supply of coffee, sugar, corn, and wheat; since the turn of the century, footballers have quickly been added to that list, with increasing numbers of top talents leaving the continent at earlier ages for a shot at stardom while the lesser lights make their way abroad simply to feed their families back home. Whichever way you look at it, South Americans are a constant in most, if not all, football leagues globally.</p>

<p>But to focus on the greatest, we must look to Europe. It is universally agreed that all the greats have plied their trade in Europe for a period of time, with very rare exceptions being made for the likes of Pelé. In the modern era, European football is the primary diet of television screens worldwide, allowing cash rich clubs to sweep up the best talents from across the world, thus creating a level of competition not found anywhere else in the world. So where do South Americans strikers lie in the grand scheme of things?</p>

<h4 id="does-european-club-football-define-talent">Does European Club Football Define Talent?</h4>

<p>In the past 47 European league seasons, South Americans have only won the European Golden Shoe 10 times; however, nine of those winners have come in the last 18 years, coinciding with the increase in South American talent across the continent. Perhaps more tellingly, in the last eight Champions League seasons, five of the Golden Boot winners have been South Americans, with only Cristiano Ronaldo bucking the trend. Rough numbers, but an indication of the changing times nonetheless. When you consider that Argentina’s haul of six European Cup / Champions League top scorers awards belong to only two of the greatest footballers of all time – Alfredo Di Stéfano and Messi – there is a more compelling case to present for the potency of South American strikers.</p>

<p>For every Messi, there is a Martín Palermo – a talent that thrived at home but never did quite make the cut with the big boys in Europe. The sheer numbers imported to European leagues ensure that there will be some flops but the numbers bandied around by clubs suggest that this is a risk worth taking, evidenced by the big moves this summer which has already seen Alexis Sánchez and Suárez swap leagues amidst much fanfare and huge fees, with Falcao possibly moving on as well. It was a similar story in 2013, as Falcao and Edinson Cavani graced Ligue 1 with their presence and massive price tags, while Gonzalo Higuaín made a big-money move to Napoli.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest statement of intent last season came from Barcelona, who stumped up €57m to sign Neymar from Santos, in a record transfer between a South American and European club. The astonishing outlay was made even more astounding by the fact that Neymar had only ever played in Brazil, a league not known for its defensive qualities, which serves to illustrate the gambles European clubs are willing to take on South American striking talents. Another £30m transfer, Erik Lamela, has yet to shine for Tottenham Hotspur, and he didn’t even move directly from Argentina, which further highlights the risk involved when signing premium South American talent.</p>

<p>Of Europe’s top leagues, it can be argued that the only one that South Americans have yet to crack is the English Premier League, but in recent seasons, the deadly finishing and high work rate of Carlos Tevez, Agüero and Suárez has suggested that South Americans are close to conquering their final frontier of world football. The likes of Ignacio Scocco continue to provide ammunition for the naysayers, but the signs are that they are almost there. Last season, Suárez became the first South American to finish as the Premier League’s top goalscorer, an astonishing stat when you consider that fellow South Americans like Sonny Anderson, Hernán Crespo, fat Ronaldo and Giovane Élber have been running away with the rest of Europe’s goalscoring charts on a regular basis.</p>

<p>The impact South American strikers have made in Europe is undeniable, and clubs are always increasingly putting their faith in these fine marksmen. A quick glance at UEFA’s club coefficient provides numbers that back up this notion; of the top 50 clubs in the rankings, 50% of them have a South American striker on the payroll. Considering that clubs like Fiorentina, Monaco and Borussia Mönchengladbach are not even part of the top 50, it certainly speaks volumes about the importance of South American hitmen in the European club game.</p>

<h4 id="implications-of-a-south-american-upbringing">Implications of A South American Upbringing?</h4>

<p>With many South American strikers (and players in general) having grown up and risen out of poverty, slums and general hardship, the hunger created almost definitely plays a pivotal role in their desire and push for success. Suárez may revile football fans worldwide for his “competitiveness”, but what if his rationale of success at all costs really has an ingrown, cognitive trigger? If we were to focus on less controversial examples, the likes of Tevez, Diego Maradona and Marcelo Salas all grew up in dire lack in comparison to their European counterparts. Brazil can count Ronaldo, Romário, and Pelé as part of the “underprivileged” club. All of them would grow up to become key strikers for club and country, making a huge impact on European and world football.</p>

<p>Aside from a hunger generally not found in Europe, the role of futsal in South America has long been recognised and lauded as a key part of youth training, and it is a wonder that very few European countries actively encourage youth players to pick it up. The lack of technical ability in England has been debated for years, and yet a key training too like futsal continues to be ignored. The national futsal side languishes at 70 in the futsal world rankings, behind luminaries such as Malaysia and Turkmenistan. Higher up the futsal rankings, the top 20 teams in the world reads like a who’s who of countries known for their technically superior players. Why is it that Europeans, for the most part, continue to ignore the indoor game? Although many European teams find themselves in the top 20, it is rare to hear of futsal being used regularly to train youngsters to improve their close control, dribbling, and quick thinking among other key skills useful in the 11-a-side game.</p>

<p>Europe produces its fair share of good strikers, but they tend to be one dimensional – very good at one or two things. Think Filippo Inzaghi, the man who was born offside. Think Ruud van Nistelrooy, the master finisher. Very rarely will you find a South American version of these two deadly strikers; their representatives tend to come in a more explosive package complete with close control and fabulous dribbling ability. With the exception of Ciro Immobile, the top scorers in Europe’s big five leagues this season are all well-rounded strikers who do much more than put the ball in the back of the net (Ronaldo, Suárez, Robert Lewandowski, Zlatan Ibrahimović). Although most of them are European, they are also exceptions to the rule and reflect the state of the game today which require a complete striker possessing an impressive repertoire of skills. Little wonder then why clubs are so willing to splash the cash on technically gifted South American frontmen.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In the summer, you had Falcao going to Monaco, Cavani going to PSG in a big transfer, Suarez everybody wanted to buy him, Higuain has gone to Napoli for a lot of money, but in Europe that is an area where it is difficult to find. In Germany, I can remember in every club you had a big striker, they produced some fantastic ones, but they do not produce young strikers. Is that a consequence of the way we coach? Of modern life? I do not know.”</p>

<h4 id="international-proving-grounds">International Proving Grounds</h4>

<p>Club football is one spectrum of the argument; perhaps it is international football where South America shines the most. At the World Cup, only 4.5 slots out of 32 are allocated to CONMEBOL teams (2014 is an exception as Brazil were hosts), meaning that South American teams regularly make up only 15.6% of the total teams in the tournament. Earlier tournaments may have had a lesser number of teams, but South American have never made up the majority of the participants, save for the 1930 edition. In fact, early editions of the World Cup held in Europe saw very few teams from South America taking part due to the distance, with only two countries taking part in the 1934 and 1954 World Cups, while Brazil were the lone South American team present in 1938.</p>

<p>In 20 editions of the World Cup, a South American has won the Golden Boot seven times – a respectable 35%, suggesting that their strikers are often punching above their weight mathematically. Furthermore, in the 2014 World Cup, 43 goals out of 171 (25.1%) were scored by South Americans while in the 2010 World Cup, they accounted for 35 goals out of 145 (24.1%). The average percentage of goals scored by South Americans in the three World Cups before 2010 is a measly 18.7%; this lends further weight to Wenger’s claims about modern European strikers not being up to par. If we take a look at the World Cup finals in its entirety, South Americans have scored 558 of the 2,379 goals to date (23.4%), while accounting for only 79 of 425 total spots for teams (18.6%).</p>

<p>Further down the footballing food chain, the U20 World Cup provides several interesting numbers to draw rough conclusions from. In 19 editions of the youth tournament, a South American team has triumphed 11 times, and have failed to produce a finalist on only five occasions. Narrowing in on goalscorers, a South American has picked up the Golden Shoe nine times, with the other 10 being won by players from all other confederations combined.</p>

<p>A quick look at the winners and runners-up of the Golden Shoe show that the South Americans seemingly go on to become top level forwards of some repute, including the likes of Messi, Agüero, Javier Saviola, Adriano, and a certain Maradona. From the other confederations, only Davor Šuker and David Trezeguet stand out (despite only claiming the Silver Shoe), and even then, the latter is of Argentinian descent and began his career in the country with Platense. Meanwhile, other Golden Shoe winners such as Pablo Couñago and Dominic Adiyiah have faded into oblivion, their early promise snuffed out rapidly at the top level of the game. The Golden Shoe is no indicator of pending South American greatness, as Henrique (2011) and Adaílton (1997) would testify, but the emerging talents from that confederation seemingly make a better fist of it than their counterparts.</p>

<h4 id="on-importing-talent">On Importing Talent</h4>

<p>Before South Americans began flooding European leagues en masse, the likes of Italy and Spain already began naturalising “citizens”, born abroad to immigrants but called back to play for their “country”. Italy has a long history of naturalised oriundo, players who were fast-tracked to the national side and hastily given passports on the strength of their ancestry, a topic excellently summarised in the <a href="http://inbedwithmaradona.com/journal/2012/7/20/a-brief-history-of-the-oriundo.html">In Bed With Maradona blog</a>. Many South American countries boast a huge population that can trace their Italian heritage, and knowing this, Italy capitalised to strengthen their national team. At the time, the Italian government allowed rapid “repatriation” for anyone of Italian descent, and this paved the way for Raimundo Orsi and Enrique Guaita to represent Italy at the 1934 World Cup, playing key roles as the Azzurri lifted their first world title.</p>

<p>In later years, Juan Alberto Schiaffino, Omar Sivori, and José Altafini would win two World Cups and a Copa América between them, before packing their bags for a one-way ticket to Italy to embrace a new future and a new national team. Although no longer widespread, the practice is still in place today, with the likes of Amauri, and most recently, Pablo Osvaldo, among Italy’s latest oriundi strikers.</p>

<p>Even Spain have imported South American talent to play for their national team, most notably the legendary Di Stéfano, who donned the red of Spain between 1957 and 1961, amassing 31 caps and scoring 23 times. Other notable names include the Argentinians, Juan Antoni0 Pizzi and José Eulogio Gárate, and the less successful Brazilians, Catanha and Diego Costa, although the latter still has time on his side. The practice of naturalising South Americans has caught on in recent times, with several countries securing forwards of South American descent to help out their national teams, including Croatia’s Eduardo and Germany’s Cacau.</p>

<h4 id="does-south-america-produce-the-best-strikers">Does South America Produce the Best Strikers?</h4>

<p>The facts have been presented, and a case can certainly be made for this theory. Although it can be argued that South American strikers regularly punch above their weight in European club football and at international level, the disparity in numbers mean that it is unlikely that the debate will be conclusively settled by one confederation outperforming another. To conclusively identify and elevate a single component of a football team supplied by a particular continent is to shoehorn the history of the game into a few concrete numbers. It can be said that the current trend does indicate a South American stranglehold on talented forwards in world football, but throughout history, there have been plenty of legendary European forwards such as Francisco Gento, Silvio Piolo, Raúl, and chief among them, Ferenc Puskás.</p>

<p>Talent is subjective, greatness even more so. Football can be described in numbers, but it cannot be defined by them. The striker debate rages on, but the protagonists involved ensure that the real winners are those watching from the sidelines.</p>
