Striking a tired pose against the goal post. Contrasting a clean, boyish face against an aged and bearded reservist, heaving at the renewed pace of the game. Breaking free of five man defences. Lounging about the pitch looking bored and uninspired. He’s scored! He’s scored for Arsenal at the Bernabeu! That’s clearly a handball!</p>

<p>Few can attest to being destined for greatness but a man like Thierry Henry has always demanded it, born of the banlieus, breaking bread in Clairefontaine and swelling the ranks of the Monaco revolution. No small wonder the likes of George Weah and David Trezeguet would reach their own pantheons of football fiefdom, while Henry himself would proceed to amble through Italy, pick up the small matter of a World Cup winners medal, and reunite with his mentor at Arsenal.</p>

<p>Like his trademark angled finish, tributes on Arsenal’s King have been done to death. The man who epitomised both the Invincibles and France’s 2010 descent into football desecration will almost always be measured in equal parts for his genius and pomp, riding the glory train right through to Camp Nou and Grand Central Terminal. Remembering Henry at his prime is like recalling one’s halcyon university days, memories wrapped in haze and embellished in later years by the glory and nostalgia of what were ultimately happy and youthful times.</p>

<p>I don’t remember the first time I saw him play, nor do I recall when he rose to prominence as Arsenal’s most lethal forward; my attention primarily focused on Dennis Bergkamp as he entered his own footballing nirvana. The double season was similarly dominated by the unbridled brilliance of Robert Pires and Freddie Ljungberg’s late goal surge, and yet the stats don’t lie: 32 goals and 7 assists for Henry tell their own tale. As Arsenal and Manchester United entered the best phase of their tempestuous rivalry, so did Ruud van Nistelrooy and Henry engage in their yearly tussle for the Golden Boot, with the Dutchman only managing to best his French counterpart during the 2002-2003 season.</p>

<p>At the forefront of every Arsenal attack stood Henry. Graceful and spritely. Cold calculation and flair. Sudden burst of acceleration, teasing and cajoling, utterly despondent or flying defiant. There were few sights as majestic as Henry running in full flight, supported by his teammates streaming forward from all sides. Effortless switching between possession-based and ruthless counter-attacking football, the Invincibles brought a distinct French-continental flair to the English game previously dominated by the devastating wingplay and tactical nous of the Class of ‘92. 39 goals, 14 assists and an entire season unbeaten.</p>

<p>A man in his prime, one of the most potent strikers of European football never to win a major award yet his genius was obvious, as the Leeds defence can attest. Henry simultaneously cast a light on those around him while enveloping them in the shadow of his 226 club goals, especially in later years as the Invincibles dismantled themselves in the name of youth and austerity measures. He inhibited his younger teammates, demanding the ball in poor positions, running into impossible areas, carrying the weight of the team with his ego. The once bit-part winger in Italy was now the focal point of a team that no longer exuberated the swagger or panache of its predecessors on British soil.</p>

<p>A final hurrah. 2006 was the crowning of the King, a headpiece of personal achievements and near misses. Taking on the captains armband, surpassing Ian Wright's milestone and Cliff Bastin's league achievements, sending off Highbury with a hattrick and ushering the Emirates era. The Champions League final. That night in Paris seared deep into the psyche of Arsenal, Jens Lehmann, Sol Campbell, Robert Pires. Henry felt he didn’t do enough, that he didn’t give his all as he bore down on the Barcelona defence, free of his marker, opening up his body to shoot the way that only Henry can, head to head with Valdes, this to extend the lead..</p>

<p>Save. Comfortably. Smothered, just like Arsenal's European dreams.</p>

<p>A final whimper. A fragmented team, torn asunder by a failed European venture and renewed competition from the domestic league, “they’ve parked their tanks and are firing 50-pound notes at us”, as Henry lay wounded on the sidelines for majority of the campaign. A campaign that ultimately went nowhere as the mediocrity that became typical of his team for the next 6 years grew to normalcy. A quiet, yet emotional end to the Arsenal way, bidden farewell via video and a Barcelona shirt presentation. An increasingly familiar sight for Gooners.</p>

<p>Years in exile. 3 leg breaks. Rising stars sold off to rivals. Banished to the wilderness of a 4th place trophy. The club cried out for another messiah, someone to lead them back to the promised land of genuine contention. The king couldn’t find room in his new kingdom for his stature, stripped of his title and relegated to the wings. He travelled to the New World and the burgeoning MLS, to re-establish himself as royalty to new servants, introducing a spectacular brand to the soccer faithful.</p>

<p>Then Arsenal called once more. The bearded pilgrim crossed the pond to rejoin, albeit temporarily, with his beloved subjects. Age has caught up with the King, who shed his electric pace along with the lines of his youth. A late night in London with Leeds visiting. A tense scoreline, Henry prepares for reintroduction to his hallowed ground. A roar erupts as his makes his way onto the pitch, looking for half a yard to write history.
 
Flashes of the old player were there, but overwhelmed by a man whose age was telling. No longer used to the rigours of English football, the strength, the commitment, the bravado, Henry was in danger of fading into irrelevant game space. The expectation was overblown. The crowd anxious and raring. Song receives the ball. Henry flits on the defence line, a split second later and he’s free. A perfect touch to set himself up for the shot. He opens his body and aims for the far corner in that old, familiar way.</p>
