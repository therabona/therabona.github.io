Slightly temperamental, moody even. Young, unknown and French, a technically sound attacking midfielder; Arsene Wenger would be proud. The decision to bring him to the club would seem like a no-brainer surely, and I better keep an eye on him in real life; Football Manager rarely gets these things wrong. Yoann Gourcuff was surely going to be a household name.</p>

<p>He had the build-up of a future superstar from playing position to cheekbones, and an early move to AC Milan seemed like the beginning of a glittering career laden with trophies, sponsorship deals, individual awards and an abundance of Youtube reels with millions of views. French legends and football contemporaries weighed in, Gourcuff is the most talented player of his generation, there is something magical about him, Gourcuff is the heir to Zidane. The heir to Zidane.</p>

<p>Le successeur. le phénonème Gourcuff, navigating his way on grass with the infamous weight of the French press and public waiting to envelope him. He should have known that the chances of his success essentially halved once the Z word was uttered; fulfilling the skill and technical ability of the man was one thing, but carrying the nation on the insoles of your feet was another entirely.</p>

<p>It didn’t help that such comparisons were less lazy than true. He moved the ball in a way that anyone would romanticise as French: elegant and graceful, uncomplicated and effective. He typically used every square inch of his feet, especially conducting  with the insteps of his shoes, just as his famed predecessor did. He occupied the same space, the same role, as a playmaker that controlled transitions and attacks ruthlessly whenever the ball came to him, and it always came to him. His ability to find a pass was needle-like, he shrugged off opponents like a coat on a rainy day, he had a penchant for scoring the spectacular as Paris-Saint Germain and Romania witnessed.</p>

<p>He inherited the introvertness, shying away from the interviews fame brought, preferring the solace of solitude and the sanctity of the self. He rubbed egos incorrectly with his apathy and lack of mollycoddling; the end of his Italian summer was fated when the demi-god Maldini decreed “Gourcuff in Milan was 100% wrong”, citing behavioural issues that hinted at a player who had problems with conviviality.</p>

<p>Retour. Bordeaux was the platform, just as it had been for Zizou all those years ago, and Gourcuff found the feet that was expected of him. 15 goals. 15 assists. Goal of the Season. Ligue 1 Player of the Year. A modest 20th for the Ballon D’Or. Gourcuff was undeniably the new darling of French football with his film star looks and the World Cup 2010 as his set. The weight was surely at its heaviest now.</p>

<p>That tournament will always be a watershed moment for French footballing history - for the poorest of reasons. A evil pantomime played out by the villainous Domenech, Anelka, Evra and Ribery. The Bordeaux man was conspired against and thrown aside, turned into a national scapegoat with the extension of an elbow and a subsequent red card. The big egos of France refused to play ball with Gourcuff, both literally and metaphorically, as he was shunned as a non-believer off the field and deliberately excluded from play off it. His inwardness was not good enough for the French big wigs, his inheritance deemed false, and when the curtains came crashing down on the campaign it took Gourcuff along with it.</p>

<p>He lost his place in the French team and in the hearts of the French masses. The heir to Zidane had bitterly disappointed, crushed under the weight of expectation, the failures of the national team and smothered by his people, his teammates, his media. A big money move to Lyon prior to the tournament did nothing to help, where the failings of the World Cup were exacerbated by a dramatic dip in form and injury. Gourcuff had his crown taken from him before it was modified for fitting.</p>

<p>He struggled to capture the form and imagination that had led to the trumpet heralds singing his name. Little niggles made it difficult for him to retain a place in the team, and the emergence of a new playmaker prince in the form of young Clement Grenier further pushed him to the fringes, bordering on Almost Famous territory.</p>

<p>The dust on the international stage had settled but Gourcuff was still reeling, injured from the nuclear fallout. Domenech’s successor, one Laurent Blanc entered the fold as national manager but Gourcuff failed to lock down a place, while Blanc opted for the nifty abilities of Samir Nasri or Mathieu Valbuena instead. Yohan Cabaye occupied the playmaker role from deep, looking to control the play, spread passes across the pitch and join the attack late, as France seemed to gravitate away from the tactics that made Zidane king. Gourcuff missed the entirety of the 2011-2012 season through injury and was subsequently omitted from Euro 2012. There was no place for him to assume and Messrs Ribery and Evra were still around, lending to the belief that Blanc opted for squad unity.</p>

<p>The new understudy. A minor role for Lyon, second to Grenier as the new Frenchman began to stereotypically court Anglo-Saxon teams in the Premier League. Flashes of brilliance hindered by injury and a lack of confidence, he was once again overlooked by Deschamps’ France. A muted 2012-2013 season; Gourcuff now is known only among the Lyon faithful and Youtube connoisseurs. The man once heralded for his inheritance is no longer even spuriously linked with a move to Arsenal, personifying a post-Zidane French footballer whose world has turned against him and cast him asunder.
 
2014 brings a new age. At 28, Gourcuff has finally shrugged both his injury concerns and the weight of Normandy from his shoulders; a chance to finally become the player the world was promised. The ability is undoubted, undeniable. His mental fortitude, one can hope has steeled with age. For France and the national team it may be too little too late, but there is yet a point to make to the world. Gourcuff was great, he is great. But he’s short of time to prove it.</p>
