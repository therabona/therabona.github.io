<p>Strange league this. Only a point needed to win the Division 1 title, but our opponents would only be made known to us moments before the match began. Not that the team needed much motivation though. This was our first time playing at this level, and the closest we have come to topping the league. It’s a short league, maximum of 10 matches to be played. The twist is that we need to secure 23 points to finish as league champions – seven wins and two draws. Eight wins if we’re feeling ambitious. With Thiago Motta having recently been nominated as part of the Ligue 1 Team of the Season, and an in-form (IF) Dimitar Berbatov on my team, anything is possible.</p>

<p>I first became manager of the team back in September 2013. The chairman had given me a call late at night, rudely interrupting the only personal time I had to myself all day. I was in the middle of some very hands-on activity, but that had to be put on hold as the unassuming, melodic ringtone of my phone threatened to ruin a pleasant night.</p>

<p>“Hello?!” I answered, with just a hint of annoyance in my voice.</p>

<p>“I need you to manage the team,” came the curt reply.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“You heard me. The team. I need a manager and you’re the one. Get online tomorrow morning to build the squad. You can call the team whatever you want and sign whoever you want as long as it fits into our budget.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, what?”</p>

<p>“Tomorrow morning. Log on and get a squad together. Any prize money won from matches may be used to strengthen the team. Goodbye.”</p>

<p>And that was how I came to become the manager of Berbagod FC. As you can tell from the name, I hold my star player, Berbatov, in high regard. The team around him isn’t half bad either. Falcao and Edinson Cavani spearhead the attack, André Ayew and Lucas Moura hug the touchline with their pacey runs, while Motta holds everything together in the middle. At the back, David Luiz and Thiago Silva form a well-oiled defensive partnership in front of Salvatore Sirigu in goal, flanked by Rod Fanni and Henri Bedimo. I had my eye on an IF pair of Maxwell and Maicon but alas, money proved to be a stumbling block. We’re not exactly AS Monaco are we?</p>

<p>To cut a long story slightly shorter, I found out the chairman wanted me to take over a team in the FIFA Ultimate Team 14 league, or FUT14 for short. There are 10 divisions, each one increasingly harder to win. Promotion and relegation applies, and where you finish in the league determines the prize money you get. Finishing as champions yields the most amount of coin, whereas a small sum awaits if you suffer relegation. They’re like parachute payments freshly relegated Premier League teams get, except this sum of money only gets us Jérémy Ménez. An upgrade on Djibril Cissé for sure, but he’s no Falcao.</p>

<p>Back to the present day. As manager of the team, so far we’ve emerged victorious against the likes of xx-fIFa-prozzz-xx, YouMadBrah, BPLsweatyyy and several other teams with names I can’t seem to recall at the moment, but they were all similar to the aforementioned monikers. Often I could tell what style of play we’d be up against just by their team name, but for the most part, they’d all play long balls over the top to Daniel Sturridge or Victor Ibarbo up front. If adventurous, they might swing the ball out to Jesús Navas or Juan Cuadrado before he whips a cross in for Samuel Eto’o who will somehow manage to outjump any defender, regardless of height, for a simple headed goal. I’m not sure if it’s the pitch we’re playing on, or if some of these guys are on performance enhancing drugs, but these two very archaic tactics seem to work quite well. José Mourinho would struggle in this league – parking the bus is a concept that doesn’t exist. In this league, strength and pace prevail.</p>

<p>But we’ve done well this season. Going against a tsunami of pace and power, the possession based passing game I implemented seems to work a treat. Cavani makes a great target man and the pace on the wings gives me an out if the middle is too congested. In his unique, languid way, Berbatov controls the middle of the field and his passes very rarely fail to reach its target. A pass is always faster than the paciest defender, although in this league, it’s a much closer contest than it should be.</p>

<p>A minute from kick-off. I find out our opponents are the delightfully, yet typically, named BeAsT FC, managed by a certain comeATmeBRO. The line-up consists of all the well-known pacey and overpowered players - Petr Čech, Vincent Kompany, Navas, André Schürrle, Eto’o, Sturridge. A challenge no doubt, but having won a total of 22 points in nine games, I was confident of Berbagod FC’s chances of getting the point needed to win Division 1. Especially since we were playing at home.</p>

<p>The match begins well, as Berbatov pings a perfect pass into the path of Cavani, who finishes unerringly to give us the lead. The Bulgarian superstar continues to put on a clinic at the age of 33, misplacing nothing while displaying quick feet and the balance of a circus performer. On the stroke of half-time, Ayew makes a darting run down the left. He cuts inside onto his right foot, selling Kompany the dummy and leaving him with a clear sight of goal. Bearing down on Čech’s goal, he spots Falcao in open space as Kompany scrambles to recover. The square ball weighted perfectly, leaving Falcao the easiest task of tapping the ball into an empty net. A huge roar erupts as the stadium gets to its feet to celebrate us taking a 2-0 lead, and at this point I think to myself that the title is almost sewn up. Moments later, the unmistakeably shrill whistle brings the half to a close, and the team heads into the dressing room in the best of spirits. This was going to be the easiest team talk I’d ever give.</p>

<p>“Alright then lads, we’re 2-0 up and 45 minutes away from the title. The passing game we’ve played so far has work a treat. Don’t change a thing about your game.”</p>

<p>“Boss, what about Sturridge?” asks Thiago Silva.</p>

<p>“What about him?”</p>

<p>“He’s fast.”</p>

<p>“And you’re tall. Don’t lose him.”</p>

<p>He nodded. The rest of the team were now engaged in banter while Sirigu was just keeping to himself, clearly trying to remain focused. I would usually rally the troops but at 2-0 up and only a point needed, I wasn’t going to play the bad guy today.</p>

<p>15 minutes were up. We headed back out, the team spread across the pitch while I made my way to the dugout. All set then for the crowning moment of our careers.</p>

<p>The first 30 minutes of the first half went to plan, as Berbatov constantly found himself on the ball. Any attacks that our opponents made were read perfectly by Thiago Silva, clearing long balls with powerful headers and reading plays like a book. He was intercepting passes and sweeping up loose balls effortlessly; the ball seemed naturally attracted to him, as if his presence masqueraded an unseen vortex.</p>

<p>Signs of change in the 70th minute. Up until now, our opponents seemed keen to play football but something had definitely changed. Four players would charge the person in possession, giving him no time to control the ball. Their stamina levels never seemed to run out; everyone was sprinting non-stop all over the pitch, closing down my players aggressively. Suddenly, our crisp passing went awry. From pinging 50-yard cross field passes effortlessly, we now could not pass the ball over five yards. Berbatov was especially at fault here. I’m not sure if he was tired or if our opponent’s superhuman pressing game was highly effective, but he was a definite culprit. The momentum had definitely shifted. It’s as if we could not control the outcome anymore.</p>

<p>The next five minutes were going to be crucial. Navas makes a dash for the byline, sprinting with a determination and vigour energy not seen in the preceding 70 minutes. He whips in a perfect cross, the ball hanging in the air for what seems like an eternity. Thiago Silva rises to meet the ball but before he can do so, David Silva jumps over him and connects, planting a simple header past Sirigu, who can only raise his arms in a futile attempt to save the ball. 2-1 and game on!</p>

<p>A minute later, Kompany plays a 60-yard through ball aimed for Sturridge, which somehow evades our entire defence as Thiago Silva misses the interception. Accelerating and reaching top speed in no time, Sirigu is left helpless as Sturridge heads for him like a tornado sweeping through town. He puts the ball into the back of the net with aplomb, as the stadium falls silent, save for the undignified cursing spouting uncontrollably from my mouth. Gamers call it raging, poker players call it going on tilt. More diplomatic folks may call it frustration, the uninitiated will call it unsportsmanlike.</p>

<p>“This cannot be happening!” I think to myself, the only words I hadn’t yelled out loud to anyone within earshot.</p>

<p>I signal Lucas over to convey the change in tactics to the rest of the team.</p>

<p>“We’re going ultra-defensive. Play on the counter. Get the ball to Cavani”</p>

<p>Lucas nods in acknowledgement. We were on the ropes and needed Cavani’s expertise in holding up play to slow down the tempo. Perhaps we could regroup and aim to get the winner in extra-time. Two minutes of injury-time were signalled by the fourth official.</p>

<p>Berbatov picks up the ball in our own half, and aims a pass towards Lucas on the wing. Four players dash to intercept the ball, with Navas nicking it while simultaneously playing a perfect through ball for Sturridge. Thiago Silva steps in to intercept the pass, but inexplicably sidesteps over the ball, allowing Sturridge to race onto the loose ball, sprinting as he had been doing continuously for the last 30 minutes. How was he not tired at all?!</p>

<p>He took aim and let rip. I had already mentally prepared to see the net bulging, while my opponents pick up the pieces of my broken dreams. But Sirigu pulls out one of the all-time great saves, leaping to his left to palm the ball behind for a corner, when it seemed more likely to be heading for the upper 90. One last corner to defend.</p>

<p>Navas hovers over the ball as I frantically motion the defenders to mark a man. There can’t be more than 10 seconds left on the clock. The ball is delivered into the area, but Thiago Silva looks to have it covered. He leaps to head the ball away, but suddenly seems to be held down by an invisible force, barely getting off the ground. Eto’o makes a late run into the area while my team simply watches him in awe, no one tracking him or even making an effort to. He meets the ball with less than perfect timing, producing a weak looping header. Sirigu would save this. 99 out of 100 times he would. But as the ball continues looping, Sirigu does not move a muscle. I cringe as it slowly dawns upon me that these outdated, archaic, obsolete, cheap and overpowered tactics are going to dash my hopes and dreams. It took less than a second, but in my mind, it played out like a horror movie in slow motion. As the ball nestled in the back of the net, Eto’o reels away in delight performing an annoyingly accurate Gangnam Style dance. I come to my senses.</p>

<p>“OH COME ON! WHAT THE HELL! CHEAP, OVERPOWERED TACTICS! TALENTLESS PRICK! FOR F***’S SAKE MAN! ALWAYS THE SAME BULLSHIT GOALS. SCREW THIS!”</p>

<p>There is no time for kick-off. The team are lying down on the pitch, some on the verge of tears. The stadium remains silent as the opposing team celebrate their victory like an oblivious third wheel at an engagement party.</p>

<p>I can’t take this. I just want to get out of the stadium and head back home. Leaving the consoling duties to captain Berbatov, I quickly make my way to the car park. My phone beeps, and I quickly glance at the screen. It’s a text from our opponent’s manager. Presumably to exchange warm congratulations for an exciting game.</p>

<p>“Haha u suk…take that loserrrr..ur gay and so is ur mum she told me last nite whn i was on top of her lolololololol”</p>

<p>I turn off my phone and rev up the car. F*** this game.</p>
