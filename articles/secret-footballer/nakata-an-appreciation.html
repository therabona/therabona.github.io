  <p>“I could feel that the team were playing just for money and not for the sake of having fun. I always felt that a team was like a big family, but it stopped being like that. I was sad, that’s why I stopped at only 29.”</p>

<p>For many of us, playing professional football is the dream. Hidetoshi Nakata was not only lucky enough to live it, he managed to reach the very top of the game is widely seen as a trailblazer for Asians to ply their trade in Europe. The 2002 World Cup jointly hosted by South Korea and Japan brought the Asian game to a whole new level and demonstrated just how important a market it was for European club football to recruit legitimate talent that paid for itself commercially. On the back of it, Lee Young-pyo and Park Ji-sung were two other Asian players that earned moves to Europe after the tournament. Players from Japan, South Korea, Iran and other Asian regions are regular features in leagues all over Europe today, but no Asian player could come close to what Nakata had to offer. Yasuhiko Okudera may have been the first Asian to score in the European Cup while Cha Bum-kun may have been the first Asian to win a European trophy, but their brilliance was unfortunate to be on show in an era where commercialism had yet to take over the game.</p>

<p>In that sense, Nakata was the perfect specimen. A huge star in Asia, his model good looks combined with his undoubted playing ability made him the ultimate package for clubs – able to deliver both on the pitch and off it. His bright performances at the 1998 World Cup made several clubs in Europe sit up and take notice, with Perugia eventually beating out several clubs to secure his signature. Critics were quick to dismiss his chances. How could the boy inspired by Captain Tsubasa make his mark in arguably the best league in the world? Comic book fantasy is one thing but cutting it in the real world was another.</p>

<p>Paying no heed to his doubters, Nakata promptly scored two goals on his debut against the reigning champions, Juventus. Perugia may have lost 4-3, but the Nakata effect was lost on no one. He would go on to score 10 league goals that season, the highest tally of his career. Over 5,000 Japanese fans turned up to see his debut in Serie A, stunning Italian officials. When Japanese travel agencies began offering one-day trips to Umbria to catch Nakata in action for Perugia, the average Japanese attendance at matches was about 3,000 – no small matter for a club whose stadium capacity was only 28,000. The replica Nakata 7 shirt was also a bestseller in Japan, with close to 70,000 being ordered.</p>

<p>By this time, Nakata’s unparalleled commercial potential was fully recognised. In addition to his marketability for any club that employed him, Nakata’s ability to spot a pass, beat a man and make late runs into the area did not go unnoticed. Amid reports of bids from Manchester United and interest from Monaco, Nakata eventually moved to Roma as Francesco Totti’s understudy for the not so tiny sum of €21m – the most expensive fee ever paid for an Asian footballer. In Rome, he enhanced his reputation further as a classy attacking midfielder, making his own impact on Italian football despite not being a regular starter for the first team. The highlight of his club career came in a crunch match against Juventus, who were Roma’s main rivals for the Scudetto in 2001. Coming on for Totti, Nakata set about imposing himself, passing the ball around and stamping his authority on the game. With Roma trailing 2-0, Nakata unleashed a 25-yard screamer past a helpless Edwin van der Sar to get Roma back into the game.</p>

<p>It was a goal that stunned the Delle Alpi and millions worldwide as they played witness to a rare sight – a Fabio Capello smile. With a minute remaining, Nakata powered another shot towards goal which van der Sar could only parry, allowing Vincenzo Montella to scramble the ball in for the equaliser. Roma had maintained their advantage at the top of the table, a lead they would not relinquish for the rest of the season. It was to be the only league title of Nakata’s career.</p>

<p>By now, Nakata was undoubtedly Asia’s best and most well-known player. Parma came calling with a bid of €28m and Roma decided to cash in on the Japanese superstar. Perhaps attracted by the opportunity of first-team football, Nakata left the reigning Italian champions, and went on to make 76 appearances in his first two seasons with Parma, winning the Coppa Italia in 2002 – the last trophy of his career. It was at this point that his form took a serious downturn. All of a sudden, he could no longer influence games and was dispossessed far too easily. Rumours of his private life were a constant topic in tabloids while fans suspecting he was far more interested in fashion and other endeavours than his career. During the season, Parma were also declared bankrupt after the owner, Calisto Tanzi, was found to have embezzled money from his Parmalat company which also went out of business. Nakata would be shipped off to Bologna, but by now, his passion was long gone, with the embers of his career fading by the day. He would change clubs three times in as many years, moving from Bologna, to Fiorentina, before winding up his career in rainy Lancashire with Bolton Wanderers. He would only score three goals in the last three years of his career.</p>

<p>At the end of Japan’s 2006 World Cup campaign, Nakata announced his retirement to the shock of the football world, especially in his native Japan. He was Asia’s best player and should have been the prime of his career at 29 years of age. But the love for the game had died a long time ago. Subsequent interviews in later years would reveal how he no longer wanted to play football as it turned into a job, as opposed to the passion he once had. But at the heart of it all was a desire to learn more about the world.</p>

<p>“All my life, I played just football. I didn't know what the world was like outside of football,” he told CNN in an interview earlier this year.</p>

<p>Since his retirement, Nakata has travelled extensively to various parts of the world, using his fame to cultivate awareness as well as to drive his philanthropic endeavours. He launched his charitable foundation, Take Action, in 2008, which organised charity matches in Japan and abroad. While on his travels, people he met would ask him about Japan and Nakata quickly discovered that he did not know much about his homeland. This prompted a self-discovery tour of his country, where he would soak up the culture and knowledge as he visited all 47 prefectures. He launched his own brand of sake as a way to preserve a key part of Japan’s tradition, having first become enamoured with wine cellars during his playing career in Italy. Nakata aims to make Japanese culture more accessible to the West, placing a high emphasis on tradition in an age where the Internet is king. Already accustomed to playing an unofficial ambassadorial role wherever he goes, few would bet against him doing just that.</p>

<p>For all his extracurricular interests, Nakata will always be remembered for his role and contribution to Asian football, proving to clubs that Asian talents are more than just marketing tools. Where people only expected him to penetrate markets, he also penetrated opposition defences with his menacing runs and incisive passing. And for that, Asia has much to thank him for.</p>

  <p>“I think football is the best tool to communicate with other people, to connect the people. It's beyond the countries, it's beyond languages. Football is the biggest thing to share, to connect the entire world so … even outside the stadium, I can play football to connect the people.”</p>
