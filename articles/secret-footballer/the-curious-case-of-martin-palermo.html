  <p>“The goals I scored were normal, Palermo makes miracles.”</p>

<p>A folk hero to Boca Juniors, Championship Manager players, and to some extent, Argentina, Martín Palermo was a player who never quite hit the heights he seemed destined for, but is still remembered fondly by those he impacted with his passionate performances on the pitch. At his testimonial, a packed La Bombonera turned out to salute the Boca legend with all the vigour of a Copa Libertadores final. After the game had finished, a tearful Palermo embraced family members and delivered a heartfelt speech to the Boca faithful as forklifts uprooted one of the goals. It was quickly wrapped with a blue and gold bow before Boca presented it to Palermo. An unorthodox present perhaps, but it was a testament to the high regard in which his club held him. What Naohiro Takahara would give for a sliver of his success…</p>

<p>More cherished in Argentina than Lionel Messi, El Loco is certainly deserving of the status, even if this is implausible to outsiders who will only remember him for his infamous hat-trick of missed penalties. Never the best technically, Palermo developed an unerring sense of positioning, enabling him to seemingly always be in the right place at the right time. If thoughts of Inzaghi come to mind, Palermo was certainly much more of an all-rounder, possessing a bullet of a header and playing an integral role in link-up play with his ability to hold up the ball. Using his foot, head, chest, knee, or seemingly any appendage, Palermo would score with any part of his body; fans on both sides declared him touched by a magic wand (a fact he embraced) due to the perceived luck and undoubted misfortune he suffered during the course of his career.</p>

<p>Such a tragedy would unfold in 2006, when his son, Stefano, tragically passed away. Declining time off, he insisted on playing that very weekend in a league match against Banfield. As fans had come to expect, Palermo did not veer from the script in the slightest, duly scoring twice as Boca Juniors emerged victorious. Substituted amidst a sea of emotion and the respect of the entire stadium, the burly striker trudged off the field having tearily paid his own small tribute to his fallen son. Such moments would endear him to the Argentinian public, but it was not the first or the last time he would touch their hearts.</p>

<p>In a country where technique and elegance is cherished and exalted, Palermo proved that heart and passion can win over the most hardened fan. He would make his international debut in 1999, having recently won the South American Footballer of the Year award in 1998 and finished as a Primera División champion with Boca. Things looked bright for the young man from La Plata, and he was called up to the Argentina squad for the 1999 Copa América. Scoring twice in Argentina’s opening match to defeat Ecuador 3-1, he could hardly have asked for a better tournament debut. However, disaster would strike in the next match against Colombia, as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWm6nQtbWK8">Palermo missed three penalties during the match</a>, with the Colombians running out 3-0 winners. It was a moment that, for many fans, would define his career, and is how he is ostensibly remembered by them to this day. Argentina would defeat Uruguay 2-0 in their next match, with Palermo again getting on the scoresheet but by now, he had obtained the dubious honour of holding the world record for the most missed penalties in an international. As a result of failing to top their group, Argentina would meet Brazil in the quarterfinals, losing 2-1. It would be 10 long years before Palermo would don the Albiceleste jersey again.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, the hottest young player in world football was no longer in demand. The raft of European clubs that had been queuing up for his services, most notably Lazio, slipped away quietly. He also suffered a serious knee injury in November in a match against Colón, a series of blows devastating enough to destroy any footballer’s career. But not Palermo. In that very same match, he remarkably played on, despite tearing the cruciate ligaments in his knee and even managed to score his 100th career goal. The injury would keep him out of action for seven months. Working his way back to full fitness, the stage could hardly have been better set for his return – a Copa Libertadores quarterfinal against their archrivals, River Plate. Coming on as a substitute, he latched onto a dangerous ball played into the penalty area. As the River defence backed off, Palermo placed the ball beyond the keeper with his left foot, sealing a 3-0 victory and sparking wild celebrations among the Boca contingent, with Carlos Bianchi beaming on the sidelines. Boca would go on to win the tournament, their first Copa Libertadores in 22 years. Later that year, Boca Juniors would defeat Real Madrid in the Intercontinental Cup, with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgc-lelpbeM">Palermo grabbing both goals</a>.</p>

<p>European clubs slowly sat up and took note of his fine return to form. At over six feet tall with an immaculate sense of positioning and heading, Palermo was a typical European striker on paper and his combination of speed and strength were favoured traits on the continent. Napoli were credited with an interest, having offered Palermo a loan deal till the end of the season. However, the only club to make a bid for him was lowly Villarreal, who eventually secured his signature.</p>

<p>“Fuck me. Palermo can do better than that,” quipped Maradona, echoing the thoughts of millions of Argentinians.</p>

<p>However, Palermo’s time in Europe would prove to be a massive disappointment. Struggling for form, Palermo must have thought his luck had turned when scoring a rare goal and instinctively went to celebrate with the Villarreal supporters. Perversely, the magic wand that seemed to hover over his shoulder struck again, with the supporters causing a separating wall to collapse on him. Palermo’s leg was crushed, broken in two places. He would take almost a year to recover from this latest setback.</p>

<p>Returning to the team in 2002, he never really made the same impact he did for Boca, and by 2003, he was shipped off to Real Betis where the same story played out. He would end his playing days in Spain at second division side Alavés before making his way back to Boca Juniors in the summer of 2004. No one could explain it. How could Palermo, a burly poacher with a keen nose for goal flop in Spain? It was certainly not caused by culture or language barriers. Perhaps he really was cursed after all.</p>

<p>Not that Boca fans were complaining though, as their hero instantly assimilated back into the team and continued from where he left off in 2001, winning several more league titles and another Copa Libertadores in 2007. He even found his way into the Guiness Book of World Records again, this time for the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_EO1bX2Gf4">longest headed goal</a> (his 200th goal for Boca), a record he would hold until it was broken by Jone Samuelson in 2011.</p>

<p>But perhaps his greatest moment of redemption came in the 2010 World Cup qualifiers. Recalled to the Argentina side by Maradona, some sections of the public were not too keen on an aging poacher spearheading their side. In the penultimate game of the qualifiers against Peru, the tie was finely poised at 0-0 when Maradona decided to bring the 35-year old on, ahead of Sergio Agüero and Carlos Tevez. Despite Gonzalo Higuaín giving Argentina the lead, Peru equalised in the 90th minute, to level the score at 1-1, leaving Argentina in serious danger of failing to qualify for the World Cup. With a final flourish, Argentina found themselves with a corner. Peru failed to clear their lines and Messi put in a low cross which took a deflection, but somehow found its way to Palermo at the far post, leaving El Loco with the simplest task of tapping the ball in for a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLUwV1S1j-g">93rd minute winner</a>. Cue mass pandemonium. Palermo reeled away in delight and relief, ripping off his shirt as his teammates mobbed him. Cameras cut away to Maradona sliding across the pitch on his belly before panning back to Palermo cutting a lone figure in the torrential rain. With his arms spread wide, he looked to the heavens, soaking up the glory of his very own Shawshank Redemption moment. Argentina would go on to defeat Uruguay in their final qualifier to secure their place in the 2010 World Cup, a tournament which Palermo would be part of.</p>

<p>“It was incomparable because it was for the national team at a time like this. I don't know if it was fate but I thank God for this triumph.” – Martín Palermo</p>

<p>In South Africa, Palermo would come on as an 80th minute substitute for Diego Milito in the final group game against Greece. Towards the end of the game, Messi went on a jinking run, evading several defenders before firing away a shot which the Greek goalkeeper could only parry into the path of Palermo. Pouncing on the rebound, he made no mistake and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB5VIbBU3WA#t=2m42s">slotted home past the Greek keeper with his weaker right foot</a>. Reeling away in delight, his face told a story of a man once vilified but now fully redeemed. His teammates mobbed him as he celebrated, sharing in the emotional moment for a legend of the Argentinian club game; this was a man held in high esteem by his peers. As his teammates assumed their positions, he made his way to the touchline, sharing a warm embrace with Maradona as the two Boca legends celebrated his achievement. The goal ensured he became the first Boca player to score at the World Cup for 80 years, while he also became Argentina’s oldest goalscorer of all-time at 36 years of age, breaking the record held by none other than Maradona.</p>

<p>The final goal of his career came in a league match against relegation favourites, Quilmes. With Boca 2-0 down, Palermo once again waved his magic wand and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oV_Nhzp9z-Q">scored a stunning piledriver</a> to bring Boca back into the game. The comeback would be completed four minutes later. Palermo would end his career as Boca Juniors’ leading goalscorer of all-time, finishing with an impressive tally of 236 goals from 404 matches. He is also the joint fourth-highest goalscorer of all time in the Primera División.</p>

<p>But perhaps, the true indication of the legacy of Saint Palermo lies at the museum of La Bombonera. There, a statue of El Loco standing over three metres tall hovers over visitors to the Museo de la Pasión Boquense – one of three in the club museum. The other two statues? Diego Maradona and Juan Román Riquelme. In a final defiant act mirroring the narrative of his career, Palermo once again finds himself in the right place at the right time. Forever.</p>
