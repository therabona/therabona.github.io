<p>As the ink dries on Antoine Griezmann's six-year contract with Atletico Madrid, the small city of Mâcon must seem worlds away from the bright lights of the Spanish capital. At his unveiling on the hallowed turf of the Vicente Calderón, there is even time to indulge in a selfie that would make the rounds online in no time. The fee shelled out remains undisclosed, but reports in Spain suggest that his buyout clause was activated, which means that Los Colchoneros were convinced that thing young Frenchman was worth around €30m. At 23 years of age, Griezmann has the world at his feet, but he could have had it sooner.</p>

<p>Griezmann is a rare breed of French footballer, having begun his youth career outside of France and thus avoiding the route taken by most Frenchman his age which ends at the famed French footballing museum managed by Arsene Wenger. Not that this was due to a lack of trying; several clubs rejected the chance to take on Griezmann as he was perceived as being too small and too weak to make the grade.</p>

<p>His route to the top began at a youth tournament organised by Paris St-Germain, where he turned in a series of impressive performances which caught the eye of Real Sociedad scouts. 14 is hardly a recommended age for a youth player to go abroad but Sociedad were firm in their interest, assuring his parents that their son would thrive under their youth regime. </p>

<p>Four years down the road, a debut beckoned for the doe-eyed Frenchman at the start of the 2009/10 season as the regular left-winger for La Real was out with an injury, giving him the chance to stake a claim for a first-team spot. A couple of substitute appearances was enough to convince the manager, Martín Lasarte, that Griezmann was ready for the big time. The youngster responded in kind, making 39 league appearances that season while cementing his spot as the team's first choice left winger. He was only 18. </p>

<p>With a left foot capable of weaving in and out of tight situations as well as finding spaces defenders could not see, Griezmann was thriving in a country that prioritised technique over physicality, a quality that would not have been afforded him in Ligue 1. His debut season could hardly have gone better, with Sociedad promoted back to La Liga and clubs such as Manchester United and Barcelona keeping an eye on his progress. </p>

<p>The Basque club had nothing to worry about; Griezmann was here to stay. Perhaps this should have been expected. Displaying maturity rarely found in modern footballers, Griezmann reiterated his desire to stay at the club that “has been like a family for me”, and went on to explain his desire to repay the club for going to extraordinary lengths to ensure he felt at home. </p>

<p>At international level, young Griezmann was already making a huge impact. Having gone virtually unnoticed due to his burgeoning career in the Spanish second division, his role in Sociedad's return to the top flight caught the attention of the France U19 manager, Francis Smerecki. Called up to face Ukraine in a two-legged friendly, he promptly scored the winner in the second leg to cement his reputation as one of the country's brightest young stars. This performance would secure him a place in the French squad for the 2010 UEFA European U19 Championship, a tournament they would go on to win in style. </p>

<p>Bigger things were expected of the youngster, both at home and abroad. One ill-judged night out after an U21 European Championship playoff against Norway changed all that. The France team had beaten the Norwegians 2-1 in the first leg, and Griezmann promptly went out with four other players despite the curfew imposed at training camp. Norway would storm into a 5-1 lead in the second leg, and although Griezmann scored after coming off the bench, the damage was done. Norway defeated France 5-3, with an aggregate score of 5-4 putting paid to France's hopes of playing in the 2013 UEFA European U21 Championship.</p>

<p>Perhaps still smarting from the player revolt at the 2010 World Cup, the FFF had been quick to discipline players who were out of line, and Griezmann and his partying teammates were subsequently banned from representing their country at any level for a year. Many fans and pundits believed he was ready to represent Les Bleus, but the ban rendered all arguments moot.</p>

<p>Such a setback would hold many footballers back. Not Griezmann. Knuckling down, he doubled up his efforts for his club and shone throughout the season, culminating in La Real’s return to the Champions League after a decade-long hiatus. His form did not go unnoticed, with Didier Deschamps keeping a close eye on the winger throughout the season. Despite missing the whole of France’s qualifying campaign for the 2014 World Cup, Deschamps called up Griezmann at the first available opportunity after his ban was served.</p>

<p>His debut came in a 2014 friendly against the Netherlands where he played the first 68 minutes. As France’s only warmup game before the provisional squad for the World Cup was to be announced, Griezmann had little time to make an impression on Deschamps. Although he did not score or register an assist, Griezmann imposed himself on the left and was involved in the build-up to France’s first goal.</p>

<p>Deschamps had no doubt. Domestically, Griezmann had just enjoyed his finest season personally, scoring 16 times and creating seven goals for Sociedad.</p>

<p>“He is decisive. He is setting up a lot of goals and is scoring also. At the end of his suspension, he is likely to be a player to join the French squad,” noted the France manager.</p>

<p>Griezmann’s subsequent inclusion in the French squad was shadowed by the furore of Samir Nasri’s exclusion, mostly from the non-French media and his Twitter poet of a girlfriend. Not that it mattered to him at all. Deschamps had showed remarkable faith in a player with only one senior cap to his name, and he was not about to let his golden chance slip.</p>

<p>With impressive performances against Paraguay and Jamaica, and Franck Ribéry injured, Griezmann’s place as France’s left winger was secured. Against Honduras, Griezmann was a constant menace and even came close to scoring himself as he fired a shot which came off the crossbar. He would go on to feature in all of France’s games at the World Cup, as France reached the quarterfinals, leaving the pitch in tears at the end of the defeat to Germany.</p>

<p>A move to Atlético Madrid may not have been what many fans and pundits expected, with several of Europe’s richer clubs reported to have been eying up a move for the diminutive winger. However, when broken down, the move makes perfect sense. He would be guaranteed first-team football at the champions of Spain, his creative style can continue to flourish in La Liga, and he has the opportunity to make an even bigger name for himself in European football.</p>

<p>His performances in the Champions League thus far have been far from impressive, having only looked good in Sociedad’s qualifying matches against Lyon, and a move to Madrid’s smaller team may stand him in good stead for his development and progress. It is not exactly the road less travelled, with superstars such as Sergio Agüero, Radamel Falcao and Diego Costa cementing their reputations before further big money moves. It may not be the conventional move for Griezmann, but if his career has been anything to go by, this unexpected change of scenery is nothing new for the kid from Mâcon.</p>
