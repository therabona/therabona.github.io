<p class="small"><strong><em>Author’s note: This is the first of a two-part series on refugees and football in Kuala Lumpur. Views expressed are his own.</em></strong></p>

<p>It’s another blistering sunny day in KL as we amble about the mosque grounds with large transparent plastic boxes, brochures and weary smiles, while countless others around the city do the same. Collecting donations is not an easy task in this city where apathy reigns supreme, and that speaks with more volume for anything concerning refugees. Malaysia has refugees? Like who, Syrians? What are refugees, aren’t those migrant workers? Bangladeshis? Not uncommon responses, albeit for the general public anywhere. Listless people everywhere trudge on into the mosque, not giving us much heed. It’s too hot for goodwill.</p>

<p><em>“…a person who, owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside his country of nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.”</em></p>

<p>The political shelter of many a displaced individual, Malaysia is home to many refugees regardless of religion or ethnicity, from Syrians and Palestinians fleeing the war, or Rohingyas and Pakistani Christians running religious persecution. As decreed by the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org.my/refugeeMsia.htm">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a>, refugees have the right to safe asylum and are entitled to the same rights and help accorded to any foreigner who is a legal resident. No human is illegal. How can such a concept exist? That’s a debate for political theorists public policy advocates maybe.</p>

<p>The reality could not be more different. Swapping refugee camps for overcrowded low cost flats, squeezing together as many as five families at a go. There are no legal or administrative mechanisms in place, landing refugees in a kind of existential limbo as a result of statelessness and a lack of official documentation. The reality could not be more different. Refugees occupy the same space as undocumented migrant workers, subject to the same treatment and harassment from the public and authorities alike. There is no access to legal employment, forcing them to consider unsavoury jobs or working in the informal sector, lending to exploitation by employers.</p>

<p>And children. Children suffer greatest from the effects of displacement; 20,000 refugee children in Malaysia have no access to formal education, robbed of the normalcy of childhood and replaced with a life of fear and poverty. Initiatives have been set up, designed to sponsor <a href="http://www.msri.org.my/v5/sahabat-programmes/sponsorship-of-refugee-children-in-malaysia/">education for kids</a> in informal refugee schools, while other NGOs strive to <a href="http://carefugees.wordpress.com/about/">feed their families</a>. Short term fixes? Hardly. These focus on the bare bones, the core struggles of the refugee. But there’s a distinct lack of community building, of inspiring children to rise about the life of the displaced into one that closer resembles ‘normal’. </p>

<p>Sport. The great human connector, fusing people at the hip from thousands of kilometers away. Football. The Greatest sport on Earth, definitely the most watched. The most televised sporting event in the world, allegiances are sworn, friendships crumble. Oh, to kick a ball. Surely if all humans are entitled to the fundamental right to life, then they also entitled to partake in the beautiful game? </p>

<p>Organise some sport. Have a conversation. Give families and children some cheer. With this backdrop, a few amateur football teams have come together to organise a refugee futsal tournament, because everyone should have the chance to score in front of their families, celebrate a goal, slide tackle theatrically, cue dramatic slow-mo cam. Refugee families, if noticed at all, are marginalised and cast aside when in actuality they are as you and I, without the privilege of a state and a normal life. A mixed futsal tournament with refugee, local and expat participation brings this conversation to the forefront. </p>

<p>Community. An opportunity for a more wholesome, holistic life. The tournament seeks to raise awareness of refugees and their plight in the eyes of the general public, enlightening the masses to the struggles of their fellow human beings. Remind people of the good things in their own lives while seeking to aid and alleviate the issues of those less fortunate. Provide some much needed joy and escapism to those who need it, allow ourselves to marvel at the universal nature of football skill and ability.
Short term fix? Hardly. The tournament serves as a platform, a voice for the voiceless for embassy, activist and middle-class urban communities to stand up and take notice. Refugees are skilled, driven and legitimate members of society, with their own families to keep and burdens to bear. A footballing conversation is the bridge to a larger one, one that speaks of resettlement and/or integration. With the right awareness, a futsal tournament will multiply into more tournaments. Snowball into an outreach programme, regular futsal games for the disenfranchised. Training, a futsal/football academy for refugee kids. Emphasise the importance of sport and community, confidence and development. Build a community from the ground up through sport. Give refugees a chance at a normal life, let them be empowered and educated, let them drive change and progress in our society. Teach ourselves to be human, to stop treating refugees, migrant workers and foreigners as something alien and untouchable. Show some solidarity, play some sport. 
Because who doesn’t love kicking a ball?</p>

<p><em>The tournament is to be held at Ampang Sports Planet, Kuala Lumpur in September 2014 in collaboration with Mountview Rangers Football Club and Carefugees. More details will be published at a later date.</em></p>
