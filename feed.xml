  &lt;p&gt;“They’re passing it as if it’s a computer game.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Martin Tyler, FIFA 14&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strange league this. Only a point needed to win the Division 1 title, but our opponents would only be made known to us moments before the match began. Not that the team needed much motivation though. This was our first time playing at this level, and the closest we have come to topping the league. It’s a short league, maximum of 10 matches to be played. The twist is that we need to secure 23 points to finish as league champions – seven wins and two draws. Eight wins if we’re feeling ambitious. With Thiago Motta having recently been nominated as part of the Ligue 1 Team of the Season, and an in-form (IF) Dimitar Berbatov on my team, anything is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first became manager of the team back in September 2013. The chairman had given me a call late at night, rudely interrupting the only personal time I had to myself all day. I was in the middle of some very hands-on activity, but that had to be put on hold as the unassuming, melodic ringtone of my phone threatened to ruin a pleasant night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hello?!” I answered, with just a hint of annoyance in my voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I need you to manage the team,” came the curt reply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You heard me. The team. I need a manager and you’re the one. Get online tomorrow morning to build the squad. You can call the team whatever you want and sign whoever you want as long as it fits into our budget.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry, what?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Tomorrow morning. Log on and get a squad together. Any prize money won from matches may be used to strengthen the team. Goodbye.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that was how I came to become the manager of Berbagod FC. As you can tell from the name, I hold my star player, Berbatov, in high regard. The team around him isn’t half bad either. Falcao and Edinson Cavani spearhead the attack, André Ayew and Lucas Moura hug the touchline with their pacey runs, while Motta holds everything together in the middle. At the back, David Luiz and Thiago Silva form a well-oiled defensive partnership in front of Salvatore Sirigu in goal, flanked by Rod Fanni and Henri Bedimo. I had my eye on an IF pair of Maxwell and Maicon but alas, money proved to be a stumbling block. We’re not exactly AS Monaco are we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To cut a long story slightly shorter, I found out the chairman wanted me to take over a team in the FIFA Ultimate Team 14 league, or FUT14 for short. There are 10 divisions, each one increasingly harder to win. Promotion and relegation applies, and where you finish in the league determines the prize money you get. Finishing as champions yields the most amount of coin, whereas a small sum awaits if you suffer relegation. They’re like parachute payments freshly relegated Premier League teams get, except this sum of money only gets us Jérémy Ménez. An upgrade on Djibril Cissé for sure, but he’s no Falcao.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the present day. As manager of the team, so far we’ve emerged victorious against the likes of xx-fIFa-prozzz-xx, YouMadBrah, BPLsweatyyy and several other teams with names I can’t seem to recall at the moment, but they were all similar to the aforementioned monikers. Often I could tell what style of play we’d be up against just by their team name, but for the most part, they’d all play long balls over the top to Daniel Sturridge or Victor Ibarbo up front. If adventurous, they might swing the ball out to Jesús Navas or Juan Cuadrado before he whips a cross in for Samuel Eto’o who will somehow manage to outjump any defender, regardless of height, for a simple headed goal. I’m not sure if it’s the pitch we’re playing on, or if some of these guys are on performance enhancing drugs, but these two very archaic tactics seem to work quite well. José Mourinho would struggle in this league – parking the bus is a concept that doesn’t exist. In this league, strength and pace prevail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we’ve done well this season. Going against a tsunami of pace and power, the possession based passing game I implemented seems to work a treat. Cavani makes a great target man and the pace on the wings gives me an out if the middle is too congested. In his unique, languid way, Berbatov controls the middle of the field and his passes very rarely fail to reach its target. A pass is always faster than the paciest defender, although in this league, it’s a much closer contest than it should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A minute from kick-off. I find out our opponents are the delightfully, yet typically, named BeAsT FC, managed by a certain comeATmeBRO. The line-up consists of all the well-known pacey and overpowered players - Petr Čech, Vincent Kompany, Navas, André Schürrle, Eto’o, Sturridge. A challenge no doubt, but having won a total of 22 points in nine games, I was confident of Berbagod FC’s chances of getting the point needed to win Division 1. Especially since we were playing at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The match begins well, as Berbatov pings a perfect pass into the path of Cavani, who finishes unerringly to give us the lead. The Bulgarian superstar continues to put on a clinic at the age of 33, misplacing nothing while displaying quick feet and the balance of a circus performer. On the stroke of half-time, Ayew makes a darting run down the left. He cuts inside onto his right foot, selling Kompany the dummy and leaving him with a clear sight of goal. Bearing down on Čech’s goal, he spots Falcao in open space as Kompany scrambles to recover. The square ball weighted perfectly, leaving Falcao the easiest task of tapping the ball into an empty net. A huge roar erupts as the stadium gets to its feet to celebrate us taking a 2-0 lead, and at this point I think to myself that the title is almost sewn up. Moments later, the unmistakeably shrill whistle brings the half to a close, and the team heads into the dressing room in the best of spirits. This was going to be the easiest team talk I’d ever give.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Alright then lads, we’re 2-0 up and 45 minutes away from the title. The passing game we’ve played so far has work a treat. Don’t change a thing about your game.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Boss, what about Sturridge?” asks Thiago Silva.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What about him?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He’s fast.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And you’re tall. Don’t lose him.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He nodded. The rest of the team were now engaged in banter while Sirigu was just keeping to himself, clearly trying to remain focused. I would usually rally the troops but at 2-0 up and only a point needed, I wasn’t going to play the bad guy today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15 minutes were up. We headed back out, the team spread across the pitch while I made my way to the dugout. All set then for the crowning moment of our careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first 30 minutes of the first half went to plan, as Berbatov constantly found himself on the ball. Any attacks that our opponents made were read perfectly by Thiago Silva, clearing long balls with powerful headers and reading plays like a book. He was intercepting passes and sweeping up loose balls effortlessly; the ball seemed naturally attracted to him, as if his presence masqueraded an unseen vortex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signs of change in the 70th minute. Up until now, our opponents seemed keen to play football but something had definitely changed. Four players would charge the person in possession, giving him no time to control the ball. Their stamina levels never seemed to run out; everyone was sprinting non-stop all over the pitch, closing down my players aggressively. Suddenly, our crisp passing went awry. From pinging 50-yard cross field passes effortlessly, we now could not pass the ball over five yards. Berbatov was especially at fault here. I’m not sure if he was tired or if our opponent’s superhuman pressing game was highly effective, but he was a definite culprit. The momentum had definitely shifted. It’s as if we could not control the outcome anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next five minutes were going to be crucial. Navas makes a dash for the byline, sprinting with a determination and vigour energy not seen in the preceding 70 minutes. He whips in a perfect cross, the ball hanging in the air for what seems like an eternity. Thiago Silva rises to meet the ball but before he can do so, David Silva jumps over him and connects, planting a simple header past Sirigu, who can only raise his arms in a futile attempt to save the ball. 2-1 and game on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A minute later, Kompany plays a 60-yard through ball aimed for Sturridge, which somehow evades our entire defence as Thiago Silva misses the interception. Accelerating and reaching top speed in no time, Sirigu is left helpless as Sturridge heads for him like a tornado sweeping through town. He puts the ball into the back of the net with aplomb, as the stadium falls silent, save for the undignified cursing spouting uncontrollably from my mouth. Gamers call it raging, poker players call it going on tilt. More diplomatic folks may call it frustration, the uninitiated will call it unsportsmanlike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This cannot be happening!” I think to myself, the only words I hadn’t yelled out loud to anyone within earshot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I signal Lucas over to convey the change in tactics to the rest of the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re going ultra-defensive. Play on the counter. Get the ball to Cavani”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucas nods in acknowledgement. We were on the ropes and needed Cavani’s expertise in holding up play to slow down the tempo. Perhaps we could regroup and aim to get the winner in extra-time. Two minutes of injury-time were signalled by the fourth official.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berbatov picks up the ball in our own half, and aims a pass towards Lucas on the wing. Four players dash to intercept the ball, with Navas nicking it while simultaneously playing a perfect through ball for Sturridge. Thiago Silva steps in to intercept the pass, but inexplicably sidesteps over the ball, allowing Sturridge to race onto the loose ball, sprinting as he had been doing continuously for the last 30 minutes. How was he not tired at all?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He took aim and let rip. I had already mentally prepared to see the net bulging, while my opponents pick up the pieces of my broken dreams. But Sirigu pulls out one of the all-time great saves, leaping to his left to palm the ball behind for a corner, when it seemed more likely to be heading for the upper 90. One last corner to defend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navas hovers over the ball as I frantically motion the defenders to mark a man. There can’t be more than 10 seconds left on the clock. The ball is delivered into the area, but Thiago Silva looks to have it covered. He leaps to head the ball away, but suddenly seems to be held down by an invisible force, barely getting off the ground. Eto’o makes a late run into the area while my team simply watches him in awe, no one tracking him or even making an effort to. He meets the ball with less than perfect timing, producing a weak looping header. Sirigu would save this. 99 out of 100 times he would. But as the ball continues looping, Sirigu does not move a muscle. I cringe as it slowly dawns upon me that these outdated, archaic, obsolete, cheap and overpowered tactics are going to dash my hopes and dreams. It took less than a second, but in my mind, it played out like a horror movie in slow motion. As the ball nestled in the back of the net, Eto’o reels away in delight performing an annoyingly accurate Gangnam Style dance. I come to my senses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“OH COME ON! WHAT THE HELL! CHEAP, OVERPOWERED TACTICS! TALENTLESS PRICK! FOR F***’S SAKE MAN! ALWAYS THE SAME BULLSHIT GOALS. SCREW THIS!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no time for kick-off. The team are lying down on the pitch, some on the verge of tears. The stadium remains silent as the opposing team celebrate their victory like an oblivious third wheel at an engagement party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t take this. I just want to get out of the stadium and head back home. Leaving the consoling duties to captain Berbatov, I quickly make my way to the car park. My phone beeps, and I quickly glance at the screen. It’s a text from our opponent’s manager. Presumably to exchange warm congratulations for an exciting game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Haha u suk…take that loserrrr..ur gay and so is ur mum she told me last nite whn i was on top of her lolololololol”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turn off my phone and rev up the car. F*** this game.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“I could feel that the team were playing just for money and not for the sake of having fun. I always felt that a team was like a big family, but it stopped being like that. I was sad, that’s why I stopped at only 29.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Hidetoshi Nakata&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many of us, playing professional football is the dream. Hidetoshi Nakata was not only lucky enough to live it, he managed to reach the very top of the game is widely seen as a trailblazer for Asians to ply their trade in Europe. The 2002 World Cup jointly hosted by South Korea and Japan brought the Asian game to a whole new level and demonstrated just how important a market it was for European club football to recruit legitimate talent that paid for itself commercially. On the back of it, Lee Young-pyo and Park Ji-sung were two other Asian players that earned moves to Europe after the tournament. Players from Japan, South Korea, Iran and other Asian regions are regular features in leagues all over Europe today, but no Asian player could come close to what Nakata had to offer. Yasuhiko Okudera may have been the first Asian to score in the European Cup while Cha Bum-kun may have been the first Asian to win a European trophy, but their brilliance was unfortunate to be on show in an era where commercialism had yet to take over the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that sense, Nakata was the perfect specimen. A huge star in Asia, his model good looks combined with his undoubted playing ability made him the ultimate package for clubs – able to deliver both on the pitch and off it. His bright performances at the 1998 World Cup made several clubs in Europe sit up and take notice, with Perugia eventually beating out several clubs to secure his signature. Critics were quick to dismiss his chances. How could the boy inspired by Captain Tsubasa make his mark in arguably the best league in the world? Comic book fantasy is one thing but cutting it in the real world was another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paying no heed to his doubters, Nakata promptly scored two goals on his debut against the reigning champions, Juventus. Perugia may have lost 4-3, but the Nakata effect was lost on no one. He would go on to score 10 league goals that season, the highest tally of his career. Over 5,000 Japanese fans turned up to see his debut in Serie A, stunning Italian officials. When Japanese travel agencies began offering one-day trips to Umbria to catch Nakata in action for Perugia, the average Japanese attendance at matches was about 3,000 – no small matter for a club whose stadium capacity was only 28,000. The replica Nakata 7 shirt was also a bestseller in Japan, with close to 70,000 being ordered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this time, Nakata’s unparalleled commercial potential was fully recognised. In addition to his marketability for any club that employed him, Nakata’s ability to spot a pass, beat a man and make late runs into the area did not go unnoticed. Amid reports of bids from Manchester United and interest from Monaco, Nakata eventually moved to Roma as Francesco Totti’s understudy for the not so tiny sum of €21m – the most expensive fee ever paid for an Asian footballer. In Rome, he enhanced his reputation further as a classy attacking midfielder, making his own impact on Italian football despite not being a regular starter for the first team. The highlight of his club career came in a crunch match against Juventus, who were Roma’s main rivals for the Scudetto in 2001. Coming on for Totti, Nakata set about imposing himself, passing the ball around and stamping his authority on the game. With Roma trailing 2-0, Nakata unleashed a 25-yard screamer past a helpless Edwin van der Sar to get Roma back into the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/OFMH5tJP9wU?start=18" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a goal that stunned the Delle Alpi and millions worldwide as they played witness to a rare sight – a Fabio Capello smile. With a minute remaining, Nakata powered another shot towards goal which van der Sar could only parry, allowing Vincenzo Montella to scramble the ball in for the equaliser. Roma had maintained their advantage at the top of the table, a lead they would not relinquish for the rest of the season. It was to be the only league title of Nakata’s career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now, Nakata was undoubtedly Asia’s best and most well-known player. Parma came calling with a bid of €28m and Roma decided to cash in on the Japanese superstar. Perhaps attracted by the opportunity of first-team football, Nakata left the reigning Italian champions, and went on to make 76 appearances in his first two seasons with Parma, winning the Coppa Italia in 2002 – the last trophy of his career. It was at this point that his form took a serious downturn. All of a sudden, he could no longer influence games and was dispossessed far too easily. Rumours of his private life were a constant topic in tabloids while fans suspecting he was far more interested in fashion and other endeavours than his career. During the season, Parma were also declared bankrupt after the owner, Calisto Tanzi, was found to have embezzled money from his Parmalat company which also went out of business. Nakata would be shipped off to Bologna, but by now, his passion was long gone, with the embers of his career fading by the day. He would change clubs three times in as many years, moving from Bologna, to Fiorentina, before winding up his career in rainy Lancashire with Bolton Wanderers. He would only score three goals in the last three years of his career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of Japan’s 2006 World Cup campaign, Nakata announced his retirement to the shock of the football world, especially in his native Japan. He was Asia’s best player and should have been the prime of his career at 29 years of age. But the love for the game had died a long time ago. Subsequent interviews in later years would reveal how he no longer wanted to play football as it turned into a job, as opposed to the passion he once had. But at the heart of it all was a desire to learn more about the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All my life, I played just football. I didn't know what the world was like outside of football,” he told CNN in an interview earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since his retirement, Nakata has travelled extensively to various parts of the world, using his fame to cultivate awareness as well as to drive his philanthropic endeavours. He launched his charitable foundation, Take Action, in 2008, which organised charity matches in Japan and abroad. While on his travels, people he met would ask him about Japan and Nakata quickly discovered that he did not know much about his homeland. This prompted a self-discovery tour of his country, where he would soak up the culture and knowledge as he visited all 47 prefectures. He launched his own brand of sake as a way to preserve a key part of Japan’s tradition, having first become enamoured with wine cellars during his playing career in Italy. Nakata aims to make Japanese culture more accessible to the West, placing a high emphasis on tradition in an age where the Internet is king. Already accustomed to playing an unofficial ambassadorial role wherever he goes, few would bet against him doing just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all his extracurricular interests, Nakata will always be remembered for his role and contribution to Asian football, proving to clubs that Asian talents are more than just marketing tools. Where people only expected him to penetrate markets, he also penetrated opposition defences with his menacing runs and incisive passing. And for that, Asia has much to thank him for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I think football is the best tool to communicate with other people, to connect the people. It's beyond the countries, it's beyond languages. Football is the biggest thing to share, to connect the entire world so … even outside the stadium, I can play football to connect the people.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Hidetoshi Nakata&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Yoann Gourcuff: A Lament</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I felt ill when Zidane retired. Watching Gourcuff has cured me. When I see players like him, I feel like a small boy again.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Christophe Dugarry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20-year old ‘wonderkid’ with a four-star scout rating.
Slightly temperamental, moody even. Young, unknown and
French, a technically sound attacking midfielder; Arsene
Wenger would be proud. The decision to bring him to the
club would seem like a no-brainer surely, and I better
keep an eye on him in real life; Football Manager rarely
gets these things wrong. Yoann Gourcuff was surely going
to be a household name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had the build-up of a future superstar from playing
position to cheekbones, and an early move to AC Milan seemed
like the beginning of a glittering career laden with trophies,
sponsorship deals, individual awards and an abundance of
Youtube reels with millions of views. French legends and
football contemporaries weighed in, Gourcuff is the most
talented player of his generation, there is something magical
about him, Gourcuff is the heir to Zidane. The heir to Zidane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Le successeur&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Le phénonème Gourcuff&lt;/em&gt;, navigating his way
on grass with the infamous weight of the French press and public waiting to envelope him. He should have known that the chances of his success essentially halved once the Z word was uttered; fulfilling the skill and technical ability of the man was one thing, but carrying the nation on the insoles of your feet was another entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn’t help that such comparisons were less lazy than true.
He moved the ball in a way that anyone would romanticise as
French: elegant and graceful, uncomplicated and effective.
He typically used every square inch of his feet, especially
conducting  with the insteps of his shoes, just as his famed
predecessor did. He occupied the same space, the same role,
as a playmaker that controlled transitions and attacks
ruthlessly whenever the ball came to him, and it always came
to him. His ability to find a pass was needle-like, he
shrugged off opponents like a coat on a rainy day, he had a
penchant for scoring the spectacular as
&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdVzzvMEG08"&gt;Paris-Saint Germain&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP6MXmFJUwc"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;
witnessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He inherited the introvertness, shying away from the
interviews fame brought, preferring the solace of solitude
and the sanctity of the self. He rubbed egos incorrectly
with his apathy and lack of mollycoddling; the end of his
Italian summer was fated when the demi-god Maldini decreed
“Gourcuff in Milan was 100% wrong”, citing behavioural issues
that hinted at a player who had problems with conviviality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Retour&lt;/em&gt;. Bordeaux was the platform, just as it had been for
Zizou all those years ago, and Gourcuff found the feet that
was expected of him. 15 goals. 15 assists. Goal of the Season.
Ligue 1 Player of the Year. A modest 20th for the Ballon D’Or.
Gourcuff was undeniably the new darling of French football
with his film star looks and the World Cup 2010 as his set.
The weight was surely at its heaviest now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That tournament will always be a watershed moment for French
footballing history - for the poorest of reasons. A evil
pantomime played out by the villainous Domenech, Anelka, Evra
and Ribery. The Bordeaux man was conspired against and thrown
aside, turned into a national scapegoat with the extension of
an elbow and a subsequent red card. The big egos of France
refused to play ball with Gourcuff, both literally and
metaphorically, as he was shunned as a non-believer off the
field and deliberately excluded from play off it. His
inwardness was not good enough for the French big wigs, his
inheritance deemed false, and when the curtains came crashing
down on the campaign it took Gourcuff along with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He lost his place in the French team and in the hearts of the
French masses. The heir to Zidane had bitterly disappointed,
crushed under the weight of expectation, the failures of the
national team and smothered by his people, his teammates, his
media. A big money move to Lyon prior to the tournament did
nothing to help, where the failings of the World Cup were
exacerbated by a dramatic dip in form and injury. Gourcuff
had his crown taken from him before it was modified for
fitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He struggled to capture the form and imagination that had led
to the trumpet heralds singing his name. Little niggles made
it difficult for him to retain a place in the team, and the
emergence of a new playmaker prince in the form of young
Clement Grenier further pushed him to the fringes, bordering
on Almost Famous territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dust on the international stage had settled but Gourcuff
was still reeling, injured from the nuclear fallout.
Domenech’s successor, one Laurent Blanc entered the fold as
national manager but Gourcuff failed to lock down a place,
while Blanc opted for the nifty abilities of Samir Nasri or
Mathieu Valbuena instead. Yohan Cabaye occupied the playmaker
role from deep, looking to control the play, spread passes
across the pitch and join the attack late, as France seemed
to gravitate away from the tactics that made Zidane king.
Gourcuff missed the entirety of the 2011-2012 season through
injury and was subsequently omitted from Euro 2012. There was
no place for him to assume and Messrs Ribery and Evra were
still around, lending to the belief that Blanc opted for
squad unity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new understudy. A minor role for Lyon, second to Grenier
as the new Frenchman began to stereotypically court
Anglo-Saxon teams in the Premier League. Flashes of
brilliance hindered by injury and a lack of confidence,
he was once again overlooked by Deschamps’ France. A muted
2012-2013 season; Gourcuff now is known only among the Lyon
faithful and Youtube connoisseurs. The man once heralded
for his inheritance is no longer even spuriously linked with
a move to Arsenal, personifying a post-Zidane French
footballer whose world has turned against him and cast him
asunder.
 
2014 brings a new age. At 28, Gourcuff has finally shrugged
both his injury concerns and the weight of Normandy from his
shoulders; a chance to finally become the player the world
was promised. The ability is undoubted,
&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoWstMvoh6U"&gt;undeniable&lt;/a&gt;.
His mental fortitude, one can hope has steeled with age.
For France and the national team it may be too little too
late, but there is yet a point to make to the world. Gourcuff
was great, he is great. But he’s short of time to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>15 Years On: Signing the King</title>

  &lt;p&gt;“The first day that he came into the dressing room, I did not dare to look him in the face. I knew everything that he had done in England.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Lionel Messi&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skyward fingers. Striking a tired pose against the goal post. Contrasting a clean, boyish face against an aged and bearded reservist, heaving at the renewed pace of the game. Breaking free of five man defences. Lounging about the pitch looking bored and uninspired. He’s scored! He’s scored for Arsenal at the Bernabeu! That’s clearly a handball!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few can attest to being destined for greatness but a man like Thierry Henry has always demanded it, born of the banlieus, breaking bread in Clairefontaine and swelling the ranks of the Monaco revolution. No small wonder the likes of George Weah and David Trezeguet would reach their own pantheons of football fiefdom, while Henry himself would proceed to amble through Italy, pick up the small matter of a World Cup winners medal, and reunite with his mentor at Arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like his trademark angled finish, tributes on Arsenal’s King have been done to death. The man who epitomised both the Invincibles and France’s 2010 descent into football desecration will almost always be measured in equal parts for his genius and pomp, riding the glory train right through to Camp Nou and Grand Central Terminal. Remembering Henry at his prime is like recalling one’s halcyon university days, memories wrapped in haze and embellished in later years by the glory and nostalgia of what were ultimately happy and youthful times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t remember the first time I saw him play, nor do I recall when he rose to prominence as Arsenal’s most lethal forward; my attention primarily focused on Dennis Bergkamp as he entered his own footballing nirvana. The double season was similarly dominated by the unbridled brilliance of Robert Pires and Freddie Ljungberg’s late goal surge, and yet the stats don’t lie: 32 goals and 7 assists for Henry tell their own tale. As Arsenal and Manchester United entered the best phase of their tempestuous rivalry, so did Ruud van Nistelrooy and Henry engage in their yearly tussle for the Golden Boot, with the Dutchman only managing to best his French counterpart during the 2002-2003 season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the forefront of every Arsenal attack stood Henry. Graceful and spritely. Cold calculation and flair. Sudden burst of acceleration, teasing and cajoling, utterly despondent or flying defiant. There were few sights as majestic as Henry running in full flight, supported by his teammates streaming forward from all sides. Effortless switching between possession-based and ruthless counter-attacking football, the Invincibles brought a distinct French-continental flair to the English game previously dominated by the devastating wingplay and tactical nous of the Class of ‘92. 39 goals, 14 assists and an entire season unbeaten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man in his prime, one of the most potent strikers of European football never to win a major award yet his genius was obvious, as the Leeds defence can attest. Henry simultaneously cast a light on those around him while enveloping them in the shadow of his 226 club goals, especially in later years as the Invincibles dismantled themselves in the name of youth and austerity measures. He inhibited his younger teammates, demanding the ball in poor positions, running into impossible areas, carrying the weight of the team with his ego. The once bit-part winger in Italy was now the focal point of a team that no longer exuberated the swagger or panache of its predecessors on British soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final hurrah. 2006 was the crowning of the King, a headpiece of personal achievements and near misses. Taking on the captains armband, surpassing Ian Wright's milestone and Cliff Bastin's league achievements, sending off Highbury with a hattrick and ushering the Emirates era. The Champions League final. That night in Paris seared deep into the psyche of Arsenal, Jens Lehmann, Sol Campbell, Robert Pires. Henry felt he didn’t do enough, that he didn’t give his all as he bore down on the Barcelona defence, free of his marker, opening up his body to shoot the way that only Henry can, head to head with Valdes, this to extend the lead..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save. Comfortably. Smothered, just like Arsenal's European dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final whimper. A fragmented team, torn asunder by a failed European venture and renewed competition from the domestic league, “they’ve parked their tanks and are firing 50-pound notes at us”, as Henry lay wounded on the sidelines for majority of the campaign. A campaign that ultimately went nowhere as the mediocrity that became typical of his team for the next 6 years grew to normalcy. A quiet, yet emotional end to the Arsenal way, bidden farewell via &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44I5daWoPfQ"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; and a Barcelona shirt presentation. An increasingly familiar sight for Gooners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years in exile. 3 leg breaks. Rising stars sold off to rivals. Banished to the wilderness of a 4th place trophy. The club cried out for another messiah, someone to lead them back to the promised land of genuine contention. The king couldn’t find room in his new kingdom for his stature, stripped of his title and relegated to the wings. He travelled to the New World and the burgeoning MLS, to re-establish himself as royalty to new servants, introducing a spectacular brand to the soccer faithful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Arsenal called once more. The bearded pilgrim crossed the pond to rejoin, albeit temporarily, with his beloved subjects. Age has caught up with the King, who shed his electric pace along with the lines of his youth. A late night in London with Leeds visiting. A tense scoreline, Henry prepares for reintroduction to his hallowed ground. A roar erupts as his makes his way onto the pitch, looking for half a yard to write history.
 
Flashes of the old player were there, but overwhelmed by a man whose age was telling. No longer used to the rigours of English football, the strength, the commitment, the bravado, Henry was in danger of fading into irrelevant game space. The expectation was overblown. The crowd anxious and raring. Song receives the ball. Henry flits on the defence line, a split second later and he’s free. A perfect touch to set himself up for the shot. He opens his body and aims for the far corner in that old, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExPNxsVJA9E"&gt;familiar way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Sunday Afternoon Kickabout with Mountview Rangers FC</title>

  &lt;p&gt;“Anyone hungry? I found some mushrooms growing by the touchline.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sun beats down on a heated Sunday afternoon; ideal time for a siesta following a heavy banana leaf lunch. Instead we pile in and trudge on to a unnamed field at a remote location to test out our aversion to heat. 4pm, a school somewhere in Taman Desa, Kuala Lumpur, a field and some footballs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After months of stalling, Mountview Rangers FC looked to get things going in sunny Malaysia and join the elite echelons of amateur football with the pipe dream of becoming an Oriental Ajax Academy for Gifted Youngsters, honing the powers of kids to supply the region with the best players. The reality is a rag-tag team of boys looking to kick a ball on a field instead of on a court, and a friendly was arranged to satisfy this need. If it exists, there is a market for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceived by a South African-Indian living in Malaysia, Mountview Rangers has closer ties to Capetown than Kuala Lumpur having been named after a suburb in the city. The team itself is composed of mostly Malaysian boys aged 17-22, itching to shrug off futsal to experience the world of field football. Most of them have probably never had the opportunity, as Malaysian schools don’t typically provide too many footballing outlets while the proliferation of futsal continues to reign supreme. To play on a field with 10 other teammates against another full team can be considered something of a luxury, or an arduous effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, the latter. Amateur football teams depend greatly on numbers: enough players who are committed to the cause as well as financial support in the form of sponsorship and/or donations. Money is needed for match kits, ground rental, referees, and league registration, all this without giving any consideration to the formalities of training, coaching, exercise and tactics. Raising the money was tough enough, finally securing the help of less-than-anonymous donors while sourcing the services of isotonic drinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.30pm. The team finally trudges in. An inaugural ceremony of sorts is underway, giving out jerseys and numbers to each teammate followed by a round of warm applause. The beginning of our football club, at the best an opportunity to join the A leagues of the country and at the worst, a grassy outlet. Pictures ensue, decked out in our full kits right down to the shinpad. Picture with arms interlinked. Picture with arms folded. Picture with drink sponsor in hand. Picture with drink in one hand, thumbs up with the other. Picture drinking drink sponsor. We’ve run the gamut of pre-season long before any warm-up has take place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5pm. The other team has trundled in. Today’s opponents are Butchers FC, a mixbag local-expat team seasoned in the lower rungs of the local leagues. The new season is upon them and they’re in need of a tune-up game to get back into shape, with the Rangers happy to oblige. Handshakes, pictures and warm-ups ensue as the heat cools, heralding the onset of evening as the players partake in a customary lap of the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what a field it was. Barely visible lines, random pieces of wood that look like mile markers, growths of mushroom where the penalty spot should be. One half of the pitch looks slightly larger than the other, the goals lack nets, the ground bumpy and uneven with more dirt than grass. In short, what you may come to expect from a school field. But it deters no one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.30pm, we’re ready for kick-off. The referee and linesmen are nowhere in sight; a quick call reveals they’re waiting at a field 20 kilometers in a different direction. Comical as it was, substitutes from each team were readily drafted into refeering roles like this is something that happens with unfortunate regularity. The game starts with a shout (no whistle) and immediately the ball goes careening off the uneven ground, flying overhead as two players come together to head a ball that they miss completely. The scene looks more akin to rugby played with a round ball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game is played in 3 periods of 30 minutes with a 5-minute break in between to allow for water, rolling substitutions and novice fitness levels. The gulf in ability between the two teams immediately becomes apparent, not in terms of technical ability but with regards to football understanding. The Rangers may be well versed in the art of kicking but confined to futsal courts, there is a real lack of basic awareness of football from positioning to simple tactics. One doesn’t need to channel their inner Michels, just remember to keep a straight backline and stop playing opposing strikers onside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The temperature reaches that glorious zone ideal for football. Butchers use their experience to plough forward, peppering the opposing defence with runs and dribbles that are dealt with in panicked hoofs to their forwards. The narrative seems to have set in: clear the ball at all costs and hope the strikers can conjure a chance from an awkward bounce. Butchers number 10, a Frenchman by the name of Emmanuel, takes up smart positions in front of the defence, causing all manner of problems for a vastly young and inexperienced team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10 minutes to go til the end of the first period and an awkward bounce determines the scoreline going into the break. A Butchers FC striker takes on a defender in the box only for the ball to flip flop off the turf and smack onto the defender’s hand. A handball shout from the striker. A handball shout from the ref. Penalty. Cooly slotted into the bottom left hand corner. A young defender deflated and cursing at the ground beneath him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First break. Drinks all around, the captain-manager tries to encourage his team. Substitutions are made, not for tactical reasons, but to ensure everyone gets to play. No room for toilet breaks. We go again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little bit of energy has been injected into the second half, as a football commentator might say. Smart interchanges between two of the Rangers players sees a couple of chances, but a quick counter and a smart finish sees the leading team go 2-0 up. Butchers FC are heckling their own player, a fairly overweight gentleman content to sit on the last defender and take pot shots at goal. Run a bit Shaun! Try and lose that spare tyre! It takes any ill will out of the game, a casual reminder to all that that the occasion is a friendly one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rangers have a set piece. A beauty of a cross is floated into the box, it’s met by a foot, it’s in the back of the non-existent net! The subs bench is elated. Mountview Rangers FC have their first goal ever, ever. The opposing team applauds the delivery and finish. Come on boys lets do that again! As the second period ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More drinks, more subs. The crowd, composed of wives, children, friends, donors, and a girl with her cat, stretch out and enjoy the evening. Hardly a break this time, as the sun threatens to set and rob the game of sight. Butchers continue to dominate and it pays off as they take a 3-1 lead. Pretty scripted ending to the game, as Rangers fling forward to try and add one more goal to their little history book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not today, as the sun sets and with it the game. Customary handshakes all around, everyone likes how that looks on TV and it feels as good as it should; like a sense of accomplishment and celebration regardless of the score. Mountview Rangers FC come away from the game disappointed by the outcome, as all boys want to do is win. But not much could be expected of inexperienced, untrained bunch of kids brought together by matching outfits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea was always to get things going, to start playing games against other teams, to feel the joy of grass beneath ones boots. There’s nothing like the space afforded by field football, the simple pleasure of rocketing a ball skyward, of set pieces. Mountview Rangers are a long way from being ready to join a league, but the numbers are there, the passion is present, the commitment is cemented. And finally at long last, so is the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Curious Case of – Martín Palermo</title>

  &lt;p&gt;“The goals I scored were normal, Palermo makes miracles.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Diego Maradona&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A folk hero to Boca Juniors, Championship Manager players, and to some extent, Argentina, Martín Palermo was a player who never quite hit the heights he seemed destined for, but is still remembered fondly by those he impacted with his passionate performances on the pitch. At his testimonial, a packed La Bombonera turned out to salute the Boca legend with all the vigour of a Copa Libertadores final. After the game had finished, a tearful Palermo embraced family members and delivered a heartfelt speech to the Boca faithful as forklifts uprooted one of the goals. It was quickly wrapped with a blue and gold bow before Boca presented it to Palermo. An unorthodox present perhaps, but it was a testament to the high regard in which his club held him. What Naohiro Takahara would give for a sliver of his success…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More cherished in Argentina than Lionel Messi, El Loco is certainly deserving of the status, even if this is implausible to outsiders who will only remember him for his infamous hat-trick of missed penalties. Never the best technically, Palermo developed an unerring sense of positioning, enabling him to seemingly always be in the right place at the right time. If thoughts of Inzaghi come to mind, Palermo was certainly much more of an all-rounder, possessing a bullet of a header and playing an integral role in link-up play with his ability to hold up the ball. Using his foot, head, chest, knee, or seemingly any appendage, Palermo would score with any part of his body; fans on both sides declared him touched by a magic wand (a fact he embraced) due to the perceived luck and undoubted misfortune he suffered during the course of his career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a tragedy would unfold in 2006, when his son, Stefano, tragically passed away. Declining time off, he insisted on playing that very weekend in a league match against Banfield. As fans had come to expect, Palermo did not veer from the script in the slightest, duly scoring twice as Boca Juniors emerged victorious. Substituted amidst a sea of emotion and the respect of the entire stadium, the burly striker trudged off the field having tearily paid his own small tribute to his fallen son. Such moments would endear him to the Argentinian public, but it was not the first or the last time he would touch their hearts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ags1HJVIIYw?start=649" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a country where technique and elegance is cherished and exalted, Palermo proved that heart and passion can win over the most hardened fan. He would make his international debut in 1999, having recently won the South American Footballer of the Year award in 1998 and finished as a Primera División champion with Boca. Things looked bright for the young man from La Plata, and he was called up to the Argentina squad for the 1999 Copa América. Scoring twice in Argentina’s opening match to defeat Ecuador 3-1, he could hardly have asked for a better tournament debut. However, disaster would strike in the next match against Colombia, as Palermo missed three penalties during the match, with the Colombians running out 3-0 winners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/SWm6nQtbWK8?start=15" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a moment that, for many fans, would define his career, and is how he is ostensibly remembered by them to this day. Argentina would defeat Uruguay 2-0 in their next match, with Palermo again getting on the scoresheet but by now, he had obtained the dubious honour of holding the world record for the most missed penalties in an international. As a result of failing to top their group, Argentina would meet Brazil in the quarterfinals, losing 2-1. It would be 10 long years before Palermo would don the Albiceleste jersey again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of a sudden, the hottest young player in world football was no longer in demand. The raft of European clubs that had been queuing up for his services, most notably Lazio, slipped away quietly. He also suffered a serious knee injury in November in a match against Colón, a series of blows devastating enough to destroy any footballer’s career. But not Palermo. In that very same match, he remarkably played on, despite tearing the cruciate ligaments in his knee and even managed to score his 100th career goal. The injury would keep him out of action for seven months. Working his way back to full fitness, the stage could hardly have been better set for his return – a Copa Libertadores quarterfinal against their archrivals, River Plate. Coming on as a substitute, he latched onto a dangerous ball played into the penalty area. As the River defence backed off, Palermo placed the ball beyond the keeper with his left foot, sealing a 3-0 victory and sparking wild celebrations among the Boca contingent, with Carlos Bianchi beaming on the sidelines. Boca would go on to win the tournament, their first Copa Libertadores in 22 years. Later that year, Boca Juniors would defeat Real Madrid in the Intercontinental Cup, with Palermo grabbing both goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/pgc-lelpbeM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European clubs slowly sat up and took note of his fine return to form. At over six feet tall with an immaculate sense of positioning and heading, Palermo was a typical European striker on paper and his combination of speed and strength were favoured traits on the continent. Napoli were credited with an interest, having offered Palermo a loan deal till the end of the season. However, the only club to make a bid for him was lowly Villarreal, who eventually secured his signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fuck me. Palermo can do better than that,” quipped Maradona, echoing the thoughts of millions of Argentinians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Palermo’s time in Europe would prove to be a massive disappointment. Struggling for form, Palermo must have thought his luck had turned when scoring a rare goal and instinctively went to celebrate with the Villarreal supporters. Perversely, the magic wand that seemed to hover over his shoulder struck again, with the supporters causing a separating wall to collapse on him. Palermo’s leg was crushed, broken in two places. He would take almost a year to recover from this latest setback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to the team in 2002, he never really made the same impact he did for Boca, and by 2003, he was shipped off to Real Betis where the same story played out. He would end his playing days in Spain at second division side Alavés before making his way back to Boca Juniors in the summer of 2004. No one could explain it. How could Palermo, a burly poacher with a keen nose for goal flop in Spain? It was certainly not caused by culture or language barriers. Perhaps he really was cursed after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not that Boca fans were complaining though, as their hero instantly assimilated back into the team and continued from where he left off in 2001, winning several more league titles and another Copa Libertadores in 2007. He even found his way into the Guiness Book of World Records again, this time for the longest headed goal (his 200th goal for Boca), a record he would hold until it was broken by Jone Samuelson in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/w_EO1bX2Gf4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But perhaps his greatest moment of redemption came in the 2010 World Cup qualifiers. Recalled to the Argentina side by Maradona, some sections of the public were not too keen on an aging poacher spearheading their side. In the penultimate game of the qualifiers against Peru, the tie was finely poised at 0-0 when Maradona decided to bring the 35-year old on, ahead of Sergio Agüero and Carlos Tevez. Despite Gonzalo Higuaín giving Argentina the lead, Peru equalised in the 90th minute, to level the score at 1-1, leaving Argentina in serious danger of failing to qualify for the World Cup. With a final flourish, Argentina found themselves with a corner. Peru failed to clear their lines and Messi put in a low cross which took a deflection, but somehow found its way to Palermo at the far post, leaving El Loco with the simplest task of tapping the ball in for a 93rd minute winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/NLUwV1S1j-g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cue mass pandemonium. Palermo reeled away in delight and relief, ripping off his shirt as his teammates mobbed him. Cameras cut away to Maradona sliding across the pitch on his belly before panning back to Palermo cutting a lone figure in the torrential rain. With his arms spread wide, he looked to the heavens, soaking up the glory of his very own Shawshank Redemption moment. Argentina would go on to defeat Uruguay in their final qualifier to secure their place in the 2010 World Cup, a tournament which Palermo would be part of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It was incomparable because it was for the national team at a time like this. I don't know if it was fate but I thank God for this triumph.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Martín Palermo&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In South Africa, Palermo would come on as an 80th minute substitute for Diego Milito in the final group game against Greece. Towards the end of the game, Messi went on a jinking run, evading several defenders before firing away a shot which the Greek goalkeeper could only parry into the path of Palermo. Pouncing on the rebound, he made no mistake and slotted home past the Greek keeper with his weaker right foot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/XB5VIbBU3WA?start=162" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reeling away in delight, his face told a story of a man once vilified but now fully redeemed. His teammates mobbed him as he celebrated, sharing in the emotional moment for a legend of the Argentinian club game; this was a man held in high esteem by his peers. As his teammates assumed their positions, he made his way to the touchline, sharing a warm embrace with Maradona as the two Boca legends celebrated his achievement. The goal ensured he became the first Boca player to score at the World Cup for 80 years, while he also became Argentina’s oldest goalscorer of all-time at 36 years of age, breaking the record held by none other than Maradona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final goal of his career came in a league match against relegation favourites, Quilmes. With Boca 2-0 down, Palermo once again waved his magic wand and scored a stunning piledriver to bring Boca back into the game. The comeback would be completed four minutes later, with the match finishing 2-2. Palermo would end his career as Boca Juniors’ leading goalscorer of all-time, finishing with an impressive tally of 236 goals from 404 matches. He is also the joint fourth-highest goalscorer of all time in the Primera División.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/oV_Nhzp9z-Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But perhaps, the true indication of the legacy of Saint Palermo lies at the museum of La Bombonera. There, a statue of El Loco standing over three metres tall hovers over visitors to the Museo de la Pasión Boquense – one of three in the club museum. The other two statues? Diego Maradona and Juan Román Riquelme. In a final defiant act mirroring the narrative of his career, Palermo once again finds himself in the right place at the right time. Forever.&lt;/p&gt;
